The traditional proofs of the meromorphic continuation of Eisenstein series, due to Selberg and Langlands, start with cuspidal Eisenstein series as a special case, and deduce the general case from spectral theory.             We present a ``soft'' proof which relies only on rudimentary Fredholm theory (needed only in the number field case). It is valid for Eisenstein series induced from an arbitrary automorphic form.             The proof relies on the principle of meromorphic continuation. It is close in spirit to Selberg's later proofs.},

The point of view is inspired by the theory of infinite dimensional unitary representations of G; this is introduced in the last sections, making this connection explicit. The topics treated include the construction of fundamental domains, the notion of automorphic form on G{\textbackslash}\&quot;G and its relationship with the classical automorphic forms on X, Poincare series, constant terms, cusp forms, finite dimensionality of the space of automorphic forms of a given type, compactness of certain convolution operators, Eisenstein series, unitary representations of G, and the spectral decomposition of L2 (G{\textbackslash}\&quot;G). The main prerequisites are some results in functional analysis (reviewed, with references) and some familiarity with the elementary theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras.  Graduate students and researchers in analytic number theory will find much to interest them in this book.},

  abstract = {We partially generalize the results of Kudla and Rallis on the poles of degenerate, Siegel-parabolic Eisenstein series to residual-data Eisenstein series. In particular, for \$a,b\$ integers greater than 1, we show that poles of the Eisenstein series induced from the Speh representation \${\textbackslash}Delta({\textbackslash}tau,b)\$ on the Levi \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{GL\}\_\{ab\}\$ of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Sp\}\_\{2ab\}\$ are located in the "segment" of half integers \$X\_\{b\}\$ between a "right endpoint" and its negative, inclusive of endpoints. The right endpoint is \${\textbackslash}pm b/2\$, or \$(b-1)/2\$, depending on the analytic properties of the automorphic \$L\$-functions attached to \${\textbackslash}tau\$. We study the automorphic forms \${\textbackslash}Phi\_\{i\}{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ obtained as residues at the points \$s\_i{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ (defined precisely in the paper) by calculating their cuspidal exponents in certain cases. In the case of the "endpoint" \$s\_0{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ and `first interior point' \$s\_1{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ in the segment of singularity points, we are able to determine a set containing {\textbackslash}textit\{all possible\} cuspidal exponents of \${\textbackslash}Phi\_0{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Phi\_1{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ precisely for all \$a\$ and \$b\$. In these cases, we use the result of the calculation to deduce that the residual automorphic forms lie in \$L{\textasciicircum}2(G(k){\textbackslash}backslash G({\textbackslash}mathbf\{A\}))\$. In a more precise sense, our result establishes a relationship between, on the one hand, the actually occurring cuspidal exponents of \${\textbackslash}Phi\_i{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$, residues at interior points which lie to the right of the origin, and, on the other hand, the "analytic properties" of the original residual-data Eisenstein series at the origin. This preprint is a longer version of the paper "Analytic Properties of Residual Eisenstein Series, I", with the details of some proofs added and some additional examples adduced in support of the main conjecture.},

  abstract = {We provide an introduction to the theory of Eisenstein series and automorphic forms on real simple Lie groups G, emphasising the role of representation theory. It is useful to take a slightly wider view and define all objects over the (rational) adeles A, thereby also paving the way for connections to number theory, representation theory and the Langlands program. Most of the results we present are already scattered throughout the mathematics literature but our exposition collects them together and is driven by examples. Many interesting aspects of these functions are hidden in their Fourier coefficients with respect to unipotent subgroups and a large part of our focus is to explain and derive general theorems on these Fourier expansions. Specifically, we give complete proofs of the Langlands constant term formula for Eisenstein series on adelic groups G(A) as well as the Casselman--Shalika formula for the p-adic spherical Whittaker function associated to unramified automorphic representations of G(Q\_p). In addition, we explain how the classical theory of Hecke operators fits into the modern theory of automorphic representations of adelic groups, thereby providing a connection with some key elements in the Langlands program, such as the Langlands dual group LG and automorphic L-functions. Somewhat surprisingly, all these results have natural interpretations as encoding physical effects in string theory. We therefore also introduce some basic concepts of string theory, aimed toward mathematicians, emphasising the role of automorphic forms. In particular, we provide a detailed treatment of supersymmetry constraints on string amplitudes which enforce differential equations of the same type that are satisfied by automorphic forms. Our treatise concludes with a detailed list of interesting open questions and pointers to additional topics which go beyond the scope of this book.},

The authors then systematically develop the subgroup structure of finite groups of Lie type as a consequence of the structural results on algebraic groups. This approach will help students to understand the relationship between these two classes of groups. The book covers many topics that are central to the subject, but missing from existing textbooks.

This book is the first comprehensive introduction to the theory of algebraic group schemes over fields that includes the structure theory of semisimple algebraic groups, and is written in the language of modern algebraic geometry. The first eight chapters study general algebraic group schemes over a field and culminate in a proof of the Barsotti--Chevalley theorem, realizing every algebraic group as an extension of an abelian variety by an affine group. After a review of the Tannakian philosophy, the author provides short accounts of Lie algebras and finite group schemes. The later chapters treat reductive algebraic groups over arbitrary fields, including the Borel--Chevalley structure theory. Solvable algebraic groups are studied in detail. Prerequisites have also been kept to a minimum so that the book is accessible to non-specialists in algebraic geometry.},

Langlands reduced this decomposition to that of the (smaller) spaces of cuspidal automorphic forms for certain subgroups of G. This book describes this proof in detail. The starting point is the theory of automorphic forms, which can also serve as a first step towards understanding the Arthur--Selberg trace formula. To make the book reasonably self-contained, the authors also provide essential background in subjects such as: automorphic forms; Eisenstein series; Eisenstein pseudo-series, and their properties. It is thus also an introduction, suitable for graduate students, to the theory of automorphic forms, the first written using contemporary terminology. It will be welcomed by number theorists, representation theorists and all whose work involves the Langlands program.},

The notion of id{\`e}le is a modification of the notion of ideal. It was introduced by the French mathematician Claude Chevalley (1909--1984) with a view to providing a suitable basis for the important local-to-global principle, i.e., for the principle which reduces problems concerning a number field K to analogous problems for the various completions Kp. Chevalley used the term ``ideal element'', which was abbreviated as id. el.},

We discuss two integrals for the standard L-function on GL2, one integral for the Spin L-function on PGSp4, and one integral for the standard L-function on Sp4. We describe how to evaluate these integrals in terms of the ``New Way'' method of Piatetski-Shapiro and Rallis. We end by discussing heuristics that inform the search and computation of Rankin-Selberg integrals.},
