In this paper we give a new presentation of MELL proof nets, without any commutative cut-elimination rule. We show how this feature induces a compact and simple proof of strong normalization, via reducibility candidates. It is the first proof of strong normalization for MELL which does not rely on any form of confluence, and so it smoothly scales up to full linear logic. Moreover, it is an axiomatic proof, as more generally it holds for every set of rewriting rules satisfying three very natural requirements with respect to substitution, commutation with promotion, full composition, and Kesner's IE property. The insight indeed comes from the theory of explicit substitutions, and from looking at the exponentials as a substitution device.},

A special case of this problem is computing the integral (1) when {$\omega$} is a holomorphic (meromorphic) form of degree p = n = dimcX; in local coordinates the form can be written as {$\omega$} = f(z) dz = f(z1, ...,zn)dz1 {$\wedge$} ... {$\wedge$} dzn, where f is a holomorphic (meromorphic) function. According to the Stokes formula, the integral (1) depends only on the homology class1 [{$\gamma$}] {$\in$} Hp(X{\textbackslash}S) and the De Rham cohomology class [{$\omega$}] {$\in$} HP(X{\textbackslash}S). Thus in integral (1) the cycle {$\gamma$} can be replaced by a cycle {$\gamma$}1 homologous to it ({$\gamma$}1 {\textasciitilde}{$\gamma$}) in X{\textbackslash}S and the form {$\omega$} can be replaced by a cohomologous form {$\omega$}1({$\omega$}1 {\textasciitilde} {$\omega$}) which may perhaps be simpler; for example, it could have poles of first order on S (see {\S} 1, Subsection 4). If {$\gamma$}j is a basis for the p-dimensional homology of the manifold X{\textbackslash}S, then by Stokes formula for any compact cycle {$\gamma$} {$\in$} Zp(X{\textbackslash}S) the integral (1) is equal to (2)\$\${\textbackslash}int\_{\textbackslash}gamma  {\textbackslash}omega   = {\textbackslash}sum{\textbackslash}limits\_j \{k\_j {\textbackslash}int\_\{y\_j \} \{{\textbackslash}omega ,\} \} \$\$where the kjare the coefficients of the cycle {$\gamma$} as a combination of the basis elements {$\gamma$}j, {$\gamma$} {\textasciitilde} {$\Sigma$}jkj{$\gamma$}j. Formula (2) shows that the problem of computing integral (1) can be reduced t1)studying the homology group Hp(X{\textbackslash}S) (finding its dimension and a basis);2)determining the coefficients of the cycle {$\gamma$} with respect to a basis;3)computing the integrals over the cycles in the basis.},

If the group is finite, we call the order of the group the class number. Not every ring will have a class number, but the class number theorem states that class group of the ring of of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field is finite. In this paper we present a proof of this theorem by building the foundations needed. Although there are less lengthy proofs to the class number theorem, this method establishes a solid understanding the class number theorem and number theoretic aspects of the class group.},

First, by using an appropriate approximate functional equation we show how to rewrite the elliptic part of the trace formula which allows one to control the Artin L-functions that that appear in the formula and to smooth out the singularities of orbital integrals. In the second part we analyze the resulting formula, isolate contributions of special representations an develop asymptotic expansions of various functions that are involved in the analysis which are needed in various analytic applications. In the final part we apply the theory developed in the previous parts to give a new proof of the {$\frac{1}{4}$}-bound of Kuznetsov towards the Ramanujan conjecture, and to carry out the analysis suggested in Langlandsfor the standard representation. This last part in particular establishes the first case of the method as suggested in Langlands.},

Girard's seminal results, concerning elementary and light linear logic, achieve this characterization by enforcing a stratification principle on proofs, using the notion of depth in proof nets. Here, we propose a more general form of stratification, based on inducing levels in proof nets by means of indexes, which allows us to extend Girard's systems while keeping the same complexity properties. In particular, it turns out that Girard's systems can be recovered by forcing depth and level to coincide. A consequence of the higher flexibility of levels with respect to depth is the absence of boxes for handling the paragraph modality. We use this fact to propose a variant of our polytime system in which the paragraph modality is only allowed on atoms, and which may thus serve as a basis for developing lambda-calculus type assignment systems with more efficient typing algorithms than existing ones.},

  abstract = {Dedicated to Professor S. C. Kleene on the occasion of his 70th birthday 0. Introduction In this essay yet another attempt at an exposition of why the A-calculus has models is made. The A-calculus was one of the first areas of research of Professor Kleene, an area in which the experience he gained was surely beneficial in his later development of recursive function theory. In what transpires below, the dialogue will be found to involve Professor Curry rather more than Kleene, since the former has written more extensively on the foundational aspects of combinatory logic. Nevertheless the early works of Church, Curry, Kleene, and Rosser were very closely integrated, and the contributions of Kleene were essential. Thus, the topic does not seem inappropriate to the occasioh. Section 1 provides a very short historical summary, and it will be found that there is considerable overlap with CURRY (1979), which is also in this volume. An earlier version of Professor Curry's paper was in any case the incentive to write the present paper, and the reader should consult Curry's contribution for further references and philosophical remarks. In Section 2 there is a review of the theory of functions and relations as sets leading up to the important notion of a continuous set mapping. In Section 3 the problem of the self-application of a function to itself as an argument is discussed from a new angle, and it is shown that-under the reduction of continuous set mappings to multi-relations-a coherent set-theoretical definition is indeed possible. The model (essentially due to PLOTKIN (1972)) of the basic laws of A-calculus thus results. Section 4 relates self-application to recursion by the proof of David Park's Theorem to the effect that the least fixed-point operator and the "paradoxical" combinator are the same in a wide class of well-behaved models. The connection thus engendered to recursion theory (r.e. sets) is outlined, and the section concludes with some remarks on recent results about ill-behaved models and on induction principles. 223},

A differential category is an additive symmetric monoidal category with a comonad (a ``coalgebra modality'') and a differential combinator. The morphisms of a differential category should be thought of as the linear maps; the differentiable or smooth maps would then be morphisms of the coKleisli category. The purpose of the present paper is to directly axiomatize differentiable maps and thus to move the emphasis from the linear notion to structures resembling the coKleisli category. The result is a setting with a more evident and intuitive relationship to the familiar notion of calculus on smooth maps. Indeed a primary example is the category whose objects are Euclidean spaces and whose morphisms are smooth maps.},

  abstract = {Differential categories were introduced to provide a minimal categorical doctrine for differential linear logic. Here we revisit the formalism and, in particular, examine the two different approaches to defining differentiation which were introduced. The basic approach used a deriving transformation, while a more refined approach, in the presence of a bialgebra modality, used a codereliction. The latter approach is particularly relevant to linear logic settings, where the coalgebra modality is monoidal and the Seely isomorphisms give rise to a bialgebra modality. Here, we prove that these apparently distinct notions of differentiation, in the presence of a monoidal coalgebra modality, are completely equivalent. Thus, for linear logic settings, there is only one notion of differentiation. This paper also presents a number of separating examples for coalgebra modalities including examples which are and are not monoidal, as well as examples which do and do not support differential structure. Of particular interest is the observation that -- somewhat counter-intuitively -- differential algebras never induce a differential category although they provide a monoidal coalgebra modality. On the other hand, Rota-Baxter algebras -- which are usually associated with integration -- provide an example of a differential category which has a non-monoidal coalgebra modality.},

The point of view is inspired by the theory of infinite dimensional unitary representations of G; this is introduced in the last sections, making this connection explicit. The topics treated include the construction of fundamental domains, the notion of automorphic form on G{\textbackslash}\&quot;G and its relationship with the classical automorphic forms on X, Poincare series, constant terms, cusp forms, finite dimensionality of the space of automorphic forms of a given type, compactness of certain convolution operators, Eisenstein series, unitary representations of G, and the spectral decomposition of L2 (G{\textbackslash}\&quot;G). The main prerequisites are some results in functional analysis (reviewed, with references) and some familiarity with the elementary theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras.  Graduate students and researchers in analytic number theory will find much to interest them in this book.},

This modality, which is a generalization of the paragraph modality of Girard's light linear logic, arises from a general categorical construction applicable to all models of linear logic. We thus learn that stratification may be formulated independently of exponential modalities; when it is forced to be connected to exponential modalities, it yields interesting complexity properties. In particular, from our analysis stem three alternative reformulations of Baillot and Mazza's linear logic by levels: one geometric, one interactive, and one semantic.},

In this paper, as well as correcting a small mistake in their paper and extending the system to deal with exponentials, we introduce a different formal system describing the intuitionistic character of FILL and we provide a full proof of the cut elimination theorem. The formal system is based on a notion of dependency between formulae within a given proof and seems of independent interest. The procedure for cut elimination applies to (classical) multiplicative Linear Logic, and we can (with care) restrict our attention to the subsystem FILL. The proof, as usual with cut elimination proofs, is a little involved and we have not seen it published anywhere.},

In particular, for \$a,b\$ integers greater than 1, we show that poles of the Eisenstein series induced from the Speh representation \${\textbackslash}Delta({\textbackslash}tau,b)\$ on the Levi \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{GL\}\_\{ab\}\$ of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Sp\}\_\{2ab\}\$ are located in the "segment" of half integers \$X\_\{b\}\$ between a "right endpoint" and its negative, inclusive of endpoints. The right endpoint is \${\textbackslash}pm b/2\$, or \$(b-1)/2\$, depending on the analytic properties of the automorphic \$L\$-functions attached to \${\textbackslash}tau\$. We study the automorphic forms \${\textbackslash}Phi\_\{i\}{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ obtained as residues at the points \$s\_i{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ (defined precisely in the paper) by calculating their cuspidal exponents in certain cases. In the case of the "endpoint" \$s\_0{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ and `first interior point' \$s\_1{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ in the segment of singularity points, we are able to determine a set containing {\textbackslash}textit\{all possible\} cuspidal exponents of \${\textbackslash}Phi\_0{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Phi\_1{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$ precisely for all \$a\$ and \$b\$. In these cases, we use the result of the calculation to deduce that the residual automorphic forms lie in \$L{\textasciicircum}2(G(k){\textbackslash}backslash G({\textbackslash}mathbf\{A\}))\$. In a more precise sense, our result establishes a relationship between, on the one hand, the actually occurring cuspidal exponents of \${\textbackslash}Phi\_i{\textasciicircum}\{(b)\}\$, residues at interior points which lie to the right of the origin, and, on the other hand, the "analytic properties" of the original residual-data Eisenstein series at the origin.

In the past decades, it has been extended to various frameworks. The most famous are indexed linear logics which can describe the resource management or the complexity analysis of a program. From an other perspective, Differential Linear Logic is a extension which allows the linearization of proofs. In this article, we merge these two directions by first defining a differential version of Graded linear logic: this is made by indexing exponential connectives with a monoid of differential operators. We prove that it is equivalent to a graded version of previously defined extension of finitary differential linear logic. We give a denotational model of our logic, based on distribution theory and linear partial differential operators with constant coefficients.},

It is a fundamental tool in several fields, most notably machine learning, where it is the key for efficiently training (deep) neural networks. Recent years have witnessed the quick growth of a research field called differentiable programming, the aim of which is to express computational graphs more synthetically and modularly by resorting to actual programming languages endowed with control flow operators and higher-order combinators, such as map and fold. In this paper, we extend the backpropagation algorithm to a paradigmatic example of such a programming language: we define a compositional program transformation from the simply-typed lambda-calculus to itself augmented with a notion of linear negation, and prove that this computes the gradient of the source program with the same efficiency as first-order backpropagation. The transformation is completely effect-free and thus provides a purely logical understanding of the dynamics of backpropagation.},

  abstract = {Intermediate in level between an advanced textbook and a monograph, this book covers both the classical and representation theoretic views of automorphic forms in a style which is accessible to graduate students entering the field. The treatment is based on complete proofs, which reveal the uniqueness principles underlying the basic constructions. The book features extensive foundational material on the representation theory of GL(1) and GL(2) over local fields, the theory of automorphic representations, L-functions and advanced topics such as the Langlands conjectures, the Weil representation, the Rankin--Selberg method and the triple L-function, examining this subject matter from many different and complementary viewpoints. Researchers as well as students will find this a valuable guide to a notoriously difficult subject.},

  abstract = {Model theory is used in every theoretical branch of analytic philosophy: in philosophy of mathematics, in philosophy of science, in philosophy of language, in philosophical logic, and in metaphysics. But these wide-ranging appeals to model theory have created a highly fragmented literature. On the one hand, many philosophically significant results are found only in mathematics textbooks: these are aimed squarely at mathematicians; they typically presuppose that the reader has a serious background in mathematics; and little clue is given as to their philosophical significance. On the other hand, the philosophical applications of these results are scattered across disconnected pockets of papers. The first aim of this book, then, is to consider the philosophical uses of model theory, focusing on the central topics of reference, realism, and doxology. Its second aim is to address important questions in the philosophy of model theory, such as: sameness of theories and structure, the boundaries of logic, and the classification of mathematical structures. Philosophy and Model Theory will be accessible to anyone who has completed an introductory logic course. It does not assume that readers have encountered model theory before, but starts right at the beginning, discussing philosophical issues that arise even with conceptually basic model theory. Moreover, the book is largely self-contained: model-theoretic notions are defined as and when they are needed for the philosophical discussion, and many of the most philosophically significant results are given accessible proofs.},

Today the use of this and other local fields pervades much of mathematics, yet these simple and natural concepts, which often provide remarkably easy solutions to complex problems, are not as familiar as they should be. This book, based on postgraduate lectures at Cambridge, is meant to rectify this situation by providing a fairly elementary and self-contained introduction to local fields. After a general introduction, attention centres on the p-adic numbers and their use in number theory. There follow chapters on algebraic number theory, diophantine equations and on the analysis of a p-adic variable. This book will appeal to undergraduates, and even amateurs, interested in number theory, as well as to graduate students.},

  abstract = {Historically, Langlands has introduced the theory of endoscopy in order to measure the failure of automorphic forms from being distinguished by their L-functions as well as the defect of stability in the Arthur-Selberg trace formula and -adic cohomology of Shimura varieties. However, the number of important achievements in the domain of automorphic forms based on the idea of endoscopy has been growing impressively recently. Among these, we will report on Arthur's classification of automorphic representations of classical groups and recent progress on the determination of -adic galois representations attached to Shimura varieties originating from Kottwitz's work. These results have now become unconditional; in particular, due to recent progress on local harmonic analysis. Among these developments, we will report on Waldspurger's work on the transfer conjecture and the proof of the fundamental lemma.},

In addition, he helped define the "Chicago school" of analysis, which remains influential to this day. In 1996, more than 300 mathematicians from around the world gathered in Chicago for a conference on harmonic analysis and partial differential equations held in Calder{\'o}n's honor. This volume originated in papers given there and presents timely syntheses of several major fields of mathematics as well as original research articles contributed by some of the finest scholars working in these areas.

  abstract = {Linear logic was conceived in 1987 by Girard and, in contrast to classical logic, restricts the usage of the structural inference rules of weakening and contraction. With this, atoms of the logic are no longer interpreted as truth, but as information or resources. This interpretation makes linear logic a useful tool for formalisation in mathematics and computer science. Linear logic has, for example, found applications in proof theory, quantum logic, and the theory of programming languages. A central problem of the logic is the question whether a given list of formulas is provable with the calculus. In the research regarding the complexity of this problem, some results were achieved, but other questions are still open. To present these questions and give new perspectives, this thesis consists of three main parts which build on each other: We present the syntax, proof theory, and various approaches to a semantics for linear logic. Here already, we will meet some open research questions. We present the current state of the complexity-theoretic characterization of the most important fragments of linear logic. Here, further research problems are presented and it becomes apparent that until now, the results have all made use of different approaches. We prove an original complexity characterization of a fragment of the logic and present ideas for a new, structural approach to the examination of provability in linear logic.},

Generalizing our previous work on intuitionistic-substructural axioms and single-conclusion (hyper)sequent calculi, we define a hierarchy on Hilbert axioms in the language of classical linear logic without exponentials. We then give a systematic procedure to transform axioms up to the level P3 of the hierarchy into inference rules in multiple-conclusion (hyper)sequent calculi, which enjoy cut-elimination under a certain condition. This allows a systematic treatment of logics which could not be dealt with in the previous approach. Our method also works as a heuristic principle for finding appropriate rules for axioms located at levels higher than P3. The case study of Abelian and Lukasiewicz logic is outlined.},

Such a classification was already known only for \$H\_1=0\$ by the work of Bo{\textbackslash}'echat, Haefliger and Hudson from 1970.

Our main result is a readily calculable classification of embeddings \$N{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}7\$ up to isotopy, with an indeterminancy. Such a classification was only known before for \$H\_1=0\$ by our earlier work from 2008. Our classification is complete when \$H\_2=0\$ or when the signature of \$N\$ is divisible neither by 64 nor by 9. The group of knots \$S{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}7\$ acts on the set of embeddings \$N{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}7\$ up to isotopy by embedded connected sum. In Part I we classified the quotient of this action. The main novelty of this paper is the description of this action for \$H\_1{\textbackslash}ne0\$, with an indeterminancy. Besides the invariants of Part I, detecting the action of knots involves a refinement of the Kreck invariant from our work of 2008. For \$N=S{\textasciicircum}1{\textbackslash}times S{\textasciicircum}3\$ we give a geometrically defined 1--1 correspondence between the set of isotopy classes of embeddings and a certain explicitly defined quotient of the set \${\textbackslash}mathbb Z{\textbackslash}oplus{\textbackslash}mathbb Z{\textbackslash}oplus{\textbackslash}mathbb Z\_\{12\}\$.},

We investigate when vector bundles admit turnings and develop the theory of turnings and their obstructions. In particular, we determine which rank-\$2k\$ bundles over the \$2k\$-sphere are turnable. If a bundle is turnable, then it is orientable. In the other direction, complex bundles are turned bundles and for bundles over finite \$CW\$-complexes with rank in the stable range, Bott's proof of his periodicity theorem shows that a turning of \$E\$ defines a homotopy class of complex structure on \$E\$. On the other hand, we give examples of rank-\$2k\$ bundles over \$2k\$-dimensional spaces, including the tangent bundles of some \$2k\$-manifolds, which are turnable but do not admit a complex structure. Hence turned bundles can be viewed as a generalisation of complex bundles. We also generalise the definition of turning to other settings, including other paths of automorphisms, and we relate the generalised turnability of vector bundles to the topology of their gauge groups and the computation of certain Samelson products.},

  abstract = {Homomorphic expansions are combinatorial invariants of knotted objects, which are universal in the sense that all finite-type (Vassiliev) invariants factor through them. Homomorphic expansions are also important as bridging objects between low-dimensional topology and quantum algebra. For example, homomorphic expansions of parenthesised braids are in one-to-one correspondence with Drinfel'd associators (Bar-Natan 1998), and homomorphic expansions of \$w\$-foams are in one-to-one correspondence with solutions to the Kashiwara-Vergne (KV) equations (Bar-Natan and the first author, 2017). The sets of Drinfel'd associators and KV solutions are both bi-torsors, with actions by the pro-unipotent Grothendieck-Teichm{\textbackslash}"\{u\}ller and Kashiwara-Vergne groups, respectively. The above correspondences are in fact maps of bi-torsors (Bar-Natan 1998, and the first and third authors with Halacheva 2022). There is a deep relationship between Drinfel'd associators and KV equations--discovered by Alekseev, Enriquez and Torossian in the 2010s--including an explicit formula constructing KV solutions in terms of associators, and an injective map \${\textbackslash}rho:{\textbackslash}mathsf\{GRT\}\_1 {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}mathsf\{KRV\}\$. This paper is a topological/diagrammatic study of the image of the Grothendieck-Teichm{\textbackslash}"\{u\}ller groups in the Kashiwara-Vergne symmetry groups, using the fact that both parenthesised braids and \$w\$-foams admit respective finite presentations as an operad and as a tensor category (circuit algebra or prop).},

  author = {D{\~u}ng, L{\^e} Th{\`a}nh},
  abstract = {This thesis aims to establish new connections between two distinct fields within theoretical computer science. The first is automata theory, whose objects of study are models of computation with limited memory. The second is the theory of programming languages, in particular of the {$\lambda$}-calculus upon which the functional paradigm is based. It is known that the functions from strings to booleans definable by programs written in the simply typed {$\lambda$}-calculus, using Church encodings, correspond exactly to regular languages. Taking this as our starting point, we give several other characterizations of automata-theoretic classes of languages and string-to-string (or even tree-to-tree) functions using {$\lambda$}-calculi with linear types. To prove those results, we develop some connections between denotational semantics -- which we use to evaluate {$\lambda$}-terms -- and categorical automata theory; in particular, we show that monoidal closed categories, which appear in the semantics of linear logic, also provide a basis to generalize some constructions on automata that morally involve function spaces. Our investigations into linear {$\lambda$}-calculi also lead us to introduce and study a new transducer model that computes string-to-string functions with polynomial growth.},

In section 3 we return to curves and outline Deligne and Mumford's proof that the stack of stable curves is a smooth and irreducible Deligne-Mumford stack which is proper over Spec Z. In section 4 we explain how to use geometric invariant to construct moduli spaces for quotient stacks. Finally, we briefly outline Gieseker's geometric invariant theory construction of the moduli scheme of projective curves defined over an algebraically closed field.

Next we apply a general notion of ``local'' differential of morphisms to the proof of a Lipschitz property of these morphisms allowing in turn to relate the observational distance on pPCF terms to a distance the model is naturally equipped with.

We extend it with new constructions, to be understood as implementing a very simple exception mechanism, and with a ``must'' parallel composition. These new operations allow to associate a context of this calculus with any point of the model and to prove full abstraction for the finite sub-calculus where ordinary lambda calculus application is not allowed.

We show that, over the ordinary locus, these operators agree with the \${\textbackslash}mod p\$ reduction of the \$p\$-adic theta operators previously studied by some of the authors. In the characteristic \$0\$, \$p\$-adic case, there is an obstruction that makes it impossible to extend the theta operators to the whole Shimura variety. On the other hand, our \${\textbackslash}mod p\$ operators extend ("analytically continue", in the language of de Shalit and Goren) to the whole Shimura variety. As a consequence, motivated by their use by Edixhoven and Jochnowitz in the case of modular forms for proving the weight part of Serre's conjecture, we discuss some effects of these operators on Galois representations. Our focus and techniques differ from those in the literature. Our intrinsic, coordinate-free approach removes difficulties that arise from working with \$q\$-expansions and works in settings where earlier techniques, which rely on explicit calculations, are not applicable. In contrast with previous constructions and analytic continuation results, these techniques work for any totally real base field, any weight, and all signatures and ranks of groups at once, recovering prior results on analytic continuation as special cases.},

It culminates in a description of Langlands's very general reciprocity conjecture, relating arbitrary motivic L-functions to the automorphic L-functions that he defined. The reciprocity conjecture is closely bound up with another fundamental conjecture of Langlands, namely his functoriality conjecture, and we give some indication of the relationship between the two.

  abstract = {Technically speaking, the transcendental syntax is about designing logics with a computational foundation. It suggests a new framework for proof theory where logic (proofs, formulas, truth, ...) is no more primitive but computation is. All the logical entities and activities will be presented as formatting/structuring on a given model of computation which should be as general, simple and natural as possible. The selected ground for logic in the transcendental syntax is a model of computation I call "stellar resolution" which is basically a logic-free reformulation of Robinson's first-order clausal resolution with a dynamics related to tile systems. An initial goal of the transcendental syntax is to retrieve linear logic from this new framework. In particular, this model naturally encodes cut-elimination for proof-structures. By using an idea of "interactive typing" reminiscent of realisability theory, it is possible to design formulas/types generalising the connectives of linear logic. Thanks to interactive typing, we are able to reach a semantic-free space where correctness criteria are seen as tests (as in unit testing or model checking) certifying logical correctness, thus allowing an effective use of logical entities.},

  abstract = {We present the stellar resolution, a "flexible" tile system based on Robinson's first-order resolution. After establishing formal definitions and basic properties of the stellar resolution, we show its Turing-completeness and to illustrate the model, we exhibit how it naturally represents computation with Horn clauses and automata as well as non-deterministic tiling constructions used in DNA computing. In the second and main part, by using the stellar resolution, we formalise and extend ideas of a new alternative to proof-net theory sketched by Girard in his transcendental syntax programme. In particular, we encode both cut-elimination and logical correctness for the multiplicative fragment of linear logic (MLL). We finally obtain completeness results for both MLL and MLL extended with the so-called MIX rule. By extending the ideas of Girard's geometry of interaction, this suggests a first step towards a new understanding of the interplay between logic and computation where linear logic is seen as a (constructed) way to format computation.},

  abstract = {We provide an introduction to the theory of Eisenstein series and automorphic forms on real simple Lie groups G, emphasising the role of representation theory. It is useful to take a slightly wider view and define all objects over the (rational) adeles A, thereby also paving the way for connections to number theory, representation theory and the Langlands program. Most of the results we present are already scattered throughout the mathematics literature but our exposition collects them together and is driven by examples. Many interesting aspects of these functions are hidden in their Fourier coefficients with respect to unipotent subgroups and a large part of our focus is to explain and derive general theorems on these Fourier expansions. Specifically, we give complete proofs of the Langlands constant term formula for Eisenstein series on adelic groups G(A) as well as the Casselman--Shalika formula for the p-adic spherical Whittaker function associated to unramified automorphic representations of G(Q\_p). In addition, we explain how the classical theory of Hecke operators fits into the modern theory of automorphic representations of adelic groups, thereby providing a connection with some key elements in the Langlands program, such as the Langlands dual group LG and automorphic L-functions. Somewhat surprisingly, all these results have natural interpretations as encoding physical effects in string theory. We therefore also introduce some basic concepts of string theory, aimed toward mathematicians, emphasising the role of automorphic forms. In particular, we provide a detailed treatment of supersymmetry constraints on string amplitudes which enforce differential equations of the same type that are satisfied by automorphic forms. Our treatise concludes with a detailed list of interesting open questions and pointers to additional topics which go beyond the scope of this book.},

The Dimension Equation is an equality satisfied by many such integrals that suggests a priority for further investigations. However there are also Rankin-Selberg integrals that do not satisfy this equation. Here we propose an extension and reformulation of the dimension equation that includes many additional cases. We explain some of these cases, including the new doubling integrals of the authors, Cai and Kaplan. We then show how this same equation can be used to understand theta liftings, and how doubling integrals fit into a lifting framework. We give an example of a new type of lift that is natural from this point of view.},

  abstract = {We firstly discuss properties of the {$L$}-groups for Brylinski-Deligne extensions of split reductive groups constructed by M. Weissman. Secondly, the Gindikin-Karpelevich formula for an arbitrary Brylinski-Deligne extension is computed and expressed in terms of naturally defined elements of the group. Following this, we show that the Gindikin-Karpelevich formula can be interpreted as Langlands-Shahidi type {$L$}-functions associated with the adjoint action of the {$L$}-group for the Levi covering subgroup on certain Lie algebras. As a consequence, the constant term of Eisenstein series for Brylinski-Deligne extensions could be expressed in terms of global (partial) Langlands-Shahidi type {$L$}-functions. These {$L$}-functions are shown to possess meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. In the end, we determine the residual spectra of Brylinski-Deligne covers of some semisimple rank one groups.},

The interpretation is done within a C*-algebra which is induced by the rule of resolution of logic programming, and therefore the execution formula can be presented as a simple logic programming loop. Part of the data is public (shared channels) but part of it can be viewed as private dialect (defined up to isomorphism) that cannot be shared during interaction, thus illustrating the theme of communication without understanding. One can prove a nilpotency (i.e. termination) theorem for this semantics, and also its soundness w.r.t. a slight modification of familiar sequent calculus in the case of exponential-free conclusions.},

This provided a new linear logic [Girard86] where hypothesis are (in some sense) used once and only once. The most surprising is that all the power of the usual logic can be recovered by means of recursive logical operators (connector "of course").},

The differential operator also allows to write the full Taylor expansion of a program. Through this expansion every program can be decomposed into an infinite sum (representing non-deterministic choice) of `simpler' programs that are strictly linear.},

We also derive explicit formulas expressing the form, as well as all its maximal parabolic Fourier coefficient, in terms of these Whittaker coefficients. A consequence of our results is the nonexistence of cusp forms in the minimal and next-to-minimal automorphic spectrum.

Our role model for this space of smooth-automorphic forms is a ''smooth version'' of the space of automorphic forms, whose internal structure was the topic of a famous paper of Franke. We prove that the important decomposition along the parabolic support, and the even finer - and structurally more important - decomposition along the cuspidal support of automorphic forms transfer in a topologized version to the larger setting of smooth-automorphic forms. In this way, we establish smooth-automorphic versions of the main results of a paper of Franke-Schwermer and of Moeglin-Waldspurger's book, III.2.6.},

This entails a description of the map Hq(mG, K, {$\Pi$} {$\otimes$} E) {$\rightarrow$} HEq is(G, E), q {$<$} qres, for all automorphic representations {$\Pi$} of G(A) appearing in the residual spectrum. Moreover, we show that below an easily computable degree qmax, the space of Eisenstein cohomology HEq is(G, E) is isomorphic to the cohomology of the space of square-integrable, residual automorphic forms. We discuss some more consequences of our result and apply it, in order to derive a result on the residual Eisenstein cohomology of inner forms of GLn and the split classical groups of type Bn, Cn, Dn.},

Symmetric monoidal closed structures are constructed in the categories of properads and of graphical sets. Strict \${\textbackslash}infty\$-properads, in which inner horns have unique fillers, are given two alternative characterizations, one in terms of graphical analogs of the Segal maps, and the other as images of the properadic nerve. The fundamental properad of an \${\textbackslash}infty\$-properad is characterized in terms of homotopy classes of \$1\$-dimensional elements. Using all connected graphs instead of connected wheel-free graphs, a parallel theory of \${\textbackslash}infty\$-wheeled properads is also developed.},

  abstract = {The fundamental texts of the great classical period in modern logic, some of them never before available in English translation, are here gathered together for the first time. Modern logic, heralded by Leibniz, may be said to have been initiated by Boole, De Morgan, and Jevons, but it was the publication in 1879 of Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift that opened a great epoch in the history of logic by presenting, in full-fledged form, the propositional calculus and quantification theory. Frege's book, translated in its entirety, begins the present volume. The emergence of two new fields, set theory and foundations of mathematics, on the borders of logic, mathematics, and philosophy, is depicted by the texts that follow. Peano and Dedekind illustrate the trend that led to Principia Mathematica. Burali-Forti, Cantor, Russell, Richard, and K{\"o}nig mark the appearance of the modern paradoxes. Hilbert, Russell, and Zermelo show various ways of overcoming these paradoxes and initiate, respectively, proof theory, the theory of types, and axiomatic set theory. Skolem generalizes L{\"o}wenheim's theorem, and he and Fraenkel amend Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory, while von Neumann offers a somewhat different system. The controversy between Hubert and Brouwer during the twenties is presented in papers of theirs and in others by Weyl, Bernays, Ackermann, and Kolmogorov. The volume concludes with papers by Herbrand and by G{\"o}del, including the latter's famous incompleteness paper. Of the forty-five contributions here collected all but five are presented in extenso. Those not originally written in English have been translated with exemplary care and exactness; the translators are themselves mathematical logicians as well as skilled interpreters of sometimes obscure texts. Each paper is introduced by a note that sets it in perspective, explains its importance, and points out difficulties in interpretation. Editorial comments and footnotes are interpolated where needed, and an extensive bibliography is included.},

The first two, set-theoretic and category-theoretic, arose within mathematics itself. After exposing a number of problems, the book considers three further perspectives formulated by logicians and philosophers of mathematics: sui generis, treating structures as abstract universals, modal, eliminating structures as objects in favor of freely entertained logical possibilities, and finally, modal-set-theoretic, a sort of synthesis of the set-theoretic and modal perspectives.},

Because these themes are at the cutting edge of a central area of modern mathematics, and are related to the philosophical base of Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem, this book will be of interest to working mathematicians and students alike. Never previously published, the contributions to this volume expose the reader to a host of difficult and thought-provoking problems.Each of the extraordinary and noteworthy mathematicians in this volume makes a unique contribution to a field that is currently seeing explosive growth. New and powerful results are being proved, radically and continually changing the field's make up. Contributions to Automorphic Forms, Geometry, and Number Theory will likely lead to vital interaction among researchers and also help prepare students and other young mathematicians to enter this exciting area of pure mathematics.Contributors: Jeffrey Adams, Jeffrey D.

This book examines this important class of Calabi--Yau manifolds from various perspectives in eighteen self-contained chapters. It starts with the basics and guides the reader to recent breakthroughs, such as the proof of the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces and structural results on Chow groups. Powerful general techniques are introduced to study the many facets of K3 surfaces, including arithmetic, homological, and differential geometric aspects. In this context, the book covers Hodge structures, moduli spaces, periods, derived categories, birational techniques, Chow rings, and deformation theory. Famous open conjectures, for example the conjectures of Calabi, Weil, and Artin--Tate, are discussed in general and for K3 surfaces in particular, and each chapter ends with questions and open problems. Based on lectures at the advanced graduate level, this book is suitable for courses and as a reference for researchers.},

The argument uses the theory of theta correspondence.

  abstract = {In 1961 Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson [2] proved that every recursively enumerable set               W               is exponential diophantine, i.e. can be represented in the form                                                                                                                  Here               P               is a polynomial with integer coefficients and the variables range over positive integers.                                         In 1970 Ju. V. Matijasevi{\v c} used this result to establish the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem. Matijasevi{\v c} proved [11] that the exponential relation               y               = 2                                x                              is diophantine This together with [2] implies that every recursively enumerable set is diophantine, i.e. every r.e. set               W               can be represented in the form                                                                                                   From this it follows that there does not exist an algorithm to decide solvability of diophantine equations. The nonexistence of such an algorithm follows immediately from the existence of r.e. nonrecursive sets.                            Now it is well known that the recursively enumerable sets               W               1               ,               W               2               ,               W               3               , {\dots} can be enumerated in such a way that the binary relation               x               {$\in$}                                W                 v                              is also recursively enumerable. Thus Matijasevi{\v c}'s theorem implies the existence of a diophantine equation               U               such that for all               x               and               v               ,},

This yields an alternative proof of the rationality and functional equation of the zeta function of an endomorphism, and a simple proof that the number of rational points modulo q of a smooth projective variety over Fq only depends on its ``birational motive''. The multiplicities of motives of abelian type over a finite field are equal to {\textpm}1. We also study motivic zeta functions, and an abstracted version of the Tate conjecture over finite fields.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we construct a proof syntax, with cut-elimination, Differential Linear Logic (DiLL), introduced by Ehrhard and Regnier, extends linear logic with a notion of linear approximation of proofs. While DiLL is classical logic, i.e. has an involutive negation, classical denotational models of it in which this notion of differentiation corresponds to the usual one, defined on any smooth function, were missing. We solve this issue by constructing a model of it based on nuclear topological vector spaces and distributions with compact support. This interpretation sheds a new light on the rules of DiLL, with a denotational model in which formulas are interpreted as spaces of distributions and cut-elimination correspond to the resolution of LPDEs. This builds a new and strong bridge between Logic and Mathematical Physics, by extending the Proof/Function part of the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence to LPDEs. We understand this result as a first step towards a more general computational theory encompassing non-linear PDEs. On a more practical level, we believe D-DiLL could lead to a type system for the verification of numerical programs. as we are able to understand them as the computational principles for the resolution of Linear Partial Differential Equations. We thus introduce D-DiLL, a deterministic refinement of DiLL with a D-exponential, for which we exhibit a cut-elimination procedure, and a categorical semantics. When D is a Linear Partial Differential Operator with constant coefficients, then the D-exponential is interpreted as the space of generalised functions {$\psi$} solutions to D{$\psi$} = {$\phi$}. The logical inference rules represents the computational steps for the construction of the solution {$\phi$}. We recover linear logic and its differential extension DiLL as a particular case.},

  abstract = {Differential Linear Logic (DiLL) adds to Linear Logic (LL) a symmetrization of three out of the four exponential rules, and by doing so allows the expression of a natural notion of differentiation. In this paper, we introduce a codigging inference rule for DiLL and study the categorical semantics of DiLL with codigging using differential categories. The addition of codigging makes the rules of DiLL completely symmetrical. We will explain how codigging is interpreted thanks to the exponential function ex, and in certain cases by the convolutional exponential. In a setting with codigging, every proof is equal to its Taylor series, which implies that every model of DiLL with codigging is quantitative. We provide examples of codigging in relational models, as well as models related to game logic and quantum programming. We also construct a graded model of DiLL with codigging in which the indices witness exponential growth. Since codigging makes the exponential of-course connective ! in LL into a monad, such that monad axioms enforce Taylor expansion, codigging opens the door to applications in programming languages, as well as further categorical generalizations.},

The cut- elimination procedure is based on a rewrite system for proof-terms with cut-permutation rules allowing the simulation of beta-reduction. Strong normalisation of the typed terms is inferred from that of the simply-typed lambda-calculus, using the notions of safe and minimal reductions as well as a simulation in Nederpelt-Klop's lambdaI-calculus. It is also shown that the type-free terms enjoy the preservation of strong normalisation (PSN) property with respect to beta-reduction in an isomorphic image of the type-free lambda-calculus.},

  abstract = {{\S} 1. Introduction               . Perhaps the most surprising recent development in complexity theory is the discovery that the class NP can be characterized using a form of randomized proof checker that only examines a constant number of bits of the ``proof'' that a string is in a language [6, 5, 31, 3, 4]. More specifically, writing {$\mid$}               x               {$\mid$} for the length of a string               x               , a language               L               in the class NP of languages recognizable in Nondeterministic polynomial time is traditionally given by a polynomial               p               and a polynomial-time predicate               P               such that a string               x               is in               L               iff there is some string               y               satisfying               P               (x, y), where {$\mid$}               y               {$\mid$} {$\leq$}               p               ({$\mid$}               x               {$\mid$}). Intuitively, we can think of a string               y               as a possible proof that               x {$\epsilon$} L               , with the predicate               P               some kind of proof checker that distinguishes good proofs from bad ones. A string               x               is therefore in a language               L               {$\epsilon$} NP if there is a short proof that               x {$\epsilon$} L               , and not in               L               otherwise. The surprising discovery is that the deterministic proof checker that reads the entire input and proof can be replaced by a probabilistic verifier that on input               x               and possible proof               y               , where               y               is presented in a certain way, flips at most               O               (log {$\mid$}               x               {$\mid$}) coins and reads at most a constant number of bits of               x               and               y               . Obviously, a probabilistic verifier that does not read the whole proof will sometimes make mistakes. However, the surprising and essentially non-intuitive mathematical fact is that for each language               L               in NP, it is possible to find a polynomial               q               and verifier               V               flipping a logarithmic number of coins and reading a constant number of bits such that, for any               x {$\epsilon$} L               , there exists               y               with {$\mid$}               y               {$\mid$} {$\leq$} q({$\mid$}               x               {$\mid$}) and with               V (x, y)               accepting with probability 1 and, for               x {$\notin$} L               , there is no               y               with {$\mid$}               y               {$\mid$} {$\leq$}               q               ({$\mid$}               x               {$\mid$}) and with               V (x, y)               accepting with probability {$\geq$} 1/4. This idea canalsobeextended to PSPACE [10, 9], using a game that alternates between two players instead of a proof presented by a ``single player.''},

  abstract = {Intertwining operators play an essential role and appear everywhere in the Langlands program, their analytic properties interact directly, yet deeply with the decomposition of parabolic induction locally and the residues of Eisenstein series globally. Inspired by the profound Langlands-Shahidi theory, Casselman-Shahidi conjectured that a certain normalization factor would govern the singularity of intertwining operators for generic standard modules. Indeed, motivated by the theory of theta correspondence, especially the Siegel-Weil formula globally, and the composition problem of degenerate principal series and the demand of a g.c.d. definition of standard \$L\$-functions in the framework of the doubling method locally, an optimal normalization factor has been determined for degenerate principal series of classical groups via the theory of integrals on prehomogeneous vector spaces. Such a method seems impossible to be generalized to work even in the setting of degenerate generalized principal series, which are naturally involved in the recent Cai-Friedberg-Ginzburg-Kaplan's generalized doubling method. To circumvent it, we discover a new uniform argument that can answer the singularity problem of intertwining operators for a large class of induced representations. As an illustration, we prove the aforementioned Casselman-Shahidi conjecture for quasi-split groups of classical type in the paper. Along the way, with the help of Shahidi's local coefficient theory, we also prove that those normalized intertwining operators are always non-zero, and provide a new one-sentence proof of the standard module conjecture in the spirit of Casselman-Shahidi.},

  abstract = {Given two proofs in a logical system with a confluent cutelimination procedure, the cut-elimination problem (CEP) is to decide whether these proofs reduce to the same normal form. This decision problem has been shown to be ptime-complete for Multiplicative Linear Logic (Mairson 2003). The latter result depends upon a restricted simulation of weakening and contraction for boolean values in MLL; in this paper, we analyze how and when this technique can be generalized to other MLL formulas, and then consider CEP for other subsystems of Linear Logic. We also show that while additives play the role of nondeterminism in cut-elimination, they are not needed to express deterministic ptime computation. As a consequence, affine features are irrelevant to expressing ptime computation. In particular, Multiplicative Light Linear Logic (MLLL) and Multiplicative Soft Linear Logic (MSLL) capture ptime even without additives nor unrestricted weakening. We establish hierarchical results on the cut-elimination problem for MLL (ptime-complete), MALL (coNP-complete), MLLL (EXPTIMEcomplete), and for MLLL (2EXPTIME-complete).},

  abstract = {Proof theory is the result of a short and tumultuous history, developed on the periphery of mainstream mathematics. Hence, its language is often idiosyn-cratic: sequent calculus, cut-elimination, subformula property, etc. This survey is designed to guide the novice reader and the itinerant mathematician along a smooth and consistent path, investigating the symbolic mechanisms of cut-elimination, and their algebraic transcription as coherence diagrams in categories with structure. This spiritual journey at the meeting point of linguistic and algebra is demanding at times, but also pleasantly rewarding: to date, no language (either formal or informal) has been studied by mathematicians as thoroughly as the language of proofs. We start the survey by a short introduction to proof theory (Chapter 1) followed by an informal explanation of the principles of denotational semantics (Chapter 2) which we understand as a representation theory for proofs-generating algebraic invariants modulo cut-elimination. After describing in full detail the cut-elimination procedure of linear logic (Chapter 3), we explain how to transcribe it into the language of categories with structure. We review three alternative formulations of *-autonomous category, or monoidal category with classical duality (Chapter 4). Then, after giving a 2-categorical account of lax and oplax monoidal adjunctions (Chapter 5) and recalling the notions of monoids and monads (Chapter 6) we relate four different categorical axiomati-zations of propositional linear logic appearing in the literature (Chapter 7). We conclude the survey by describing two concrete models of linear logic, based on coherence spaces and sequential games (Chapter 8) and by discussing a series of future research directions (Chapter 9).},

Thus, wavelets are ideal in many fields where an approach to transient behaviour is needed, for example, in considering acoustic or seismic signals, or in image processing. Yves Meyer stands the theory of wavelets firmly upon solid ground by basing his book on the fundamental work of Calder{\'o}n, Zygmund and their collaborators.

This book is the first comprehensive introduction to the theory of algebraic group schemes over fields that includes the structure theory of semisimple algebraic groups, and is written in the language of modern algebraic geometry. The first eight chapters study general algebraic group schemes over a field and culminate in a proof of the Barsotti--Chevalley theorem, realizing every algebraic group as an extension of an abelian variety by an affine group. After a review of the Tannakian philosophy, the author provides short accounts of Lie algebras and finite group schemes. The later chapters treat reductive algebraic groups over arbitrary fields, including the Borel--Chevalley structure theory. Solvable algebraic groups are studied in detail. Prerequisites have also been kept to a minimum so that the book is accessible to non-specialists in algebraic geometry.},

Langlands reduced this decomposition to that of the (smaller) spaces of cuspidal automorphic forms for certain subgroups of G. This book describes this proof in detail. The starting point is the theory of automorphic forms, which can also serve as a first step towards understanding the Arthur--Selberg trace formula. To make the book reasonably self-contained, the authors also provide essential background in subjects such as: automorphic forms; Eisenstein series; Eisenstein pseudo-series, and their properties. It is thus also an introduction, suitable for graduate students, to the theory of automorphic forms, the first written using contemporary terminology. It will be welcomed by number theorists, representation theorists and all whose work involves the Langlands program.},

However, if one goes further and uses {$\beta\eta$}-conversion to prove equivalence of programs, then a gross simplification is introduced (programs are identified with total functions from values to values), that may jeopardise the applicability of theoretical results. In this paper we introduce calculi based on a categorical semantics for computations, that provide a correct basis for proving equivalence of programs, for a wide range of notions of computation.},

In our telling of the story the fundamental duality is not between proofs and programs but between local (sequent calculus) and global (lambda calculus or natural deduction) points of view on a common logico-computational mathematical structure.},

This gentle step-by-step introduction is ideal for graduate students and researchers who need to understand the ins and outs of the mathematical machinery, the role of logical rules therein, the essential contribution of definitions and the decisive nature of well-structured proofs. The authors begin with untyped lambda calculus and proceed to several fundamental type systems, including the well-known and powerful Calculus of Constructions. The book also covers the essence of proof checking and proof development, and the use of dependent type theory to formalise mathematics. The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of undergraduate mathematics. Carefully chosen examples illustrate the theory throughout. Each chapter ends with a summary of the content, some historical context, suggestions for further reading and a selection of exercises to help readers familiarise themselves with the material.},

The book therefore focuses on Serre's GAGA theorem, which perhaps best encapsulates the link between algebra and analysis. GAGA provides the unifying theme of the book: we develop enough of the modern machinery of algebraic geometry to be able to give an essentially complete proof, at a level accessible to undergraduates throughout. The book is based on a course which the author has taught, twice, at the Australian National University.},

We prove something weaker in the projective case. The main techniques are a spectral sequence argument borrowed from topology and the converse ghost lemma, both suitably adapted to work in this setting.

We introduce sliced pure structures (sps), a very general version of Girard's proof-nets, and we apply to sps Gandy's method to infer SN from weak normalization (WN). We prove a standardization theorem for sps: if WN without erasing steps holds for an sps, then it enjoys SN. A key step in our proof of standardization is a confluence theorem for sps obtained by using only a very weak form of correctness, namely acyclicity slice by slice. We conclude by showing how standardization for sps allows to prove SN of LL, using as usual Girard's reducibility candidates.},

Let AA{\textbackslash}mathbb\{A\} be the ring of adeles. A fundamental problem in the theory of automorphic forms is to decompose the right regular representation of G(A)G(A)G{\textbackslash}left( {\textbackslash}mathbb\{A\} {\textbackslash}right) acting on the Hilbert space L2(G(F)∖G(A))L2(G(F)∖G(A))\{\{L\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\}{\textbackslash}left( G{\textbackslash}left( F {\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}backslash G{\textbackslash}left( {\textbackslash}mathbb\{A\} {\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}right). Main contributions have been made by Langlands. He described, using his theory of Eisenstein series, an orthogonal decomposition of this space of the form:  L2dis(G(F)∖G(A))={$\oplus$}(M,{$\pi$})L2dis(G(F)∖G(A))(M,{$\pi$}),where(M,{$\pi$})Ldis2(G(F)∖G(A))={$\oplus$}(M,{$\pi$})Ldis2(G(F)∖G(A))(M,{$\pi$}),where(M,{$\pi$})L\_\{dis\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}left( G{\textbackslash}left( F {\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}backslash G{\textbackslash}left( {\textbackslash}mathbb\{A\} {\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash},={\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\_\{{\textbackslash}left( M,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}pi  {\textbackslash}right)\}\}L\_\{dis\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\{\{{\textbackslash}left( G{\textbackslash}left( F {\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}backslash G{\textbackslash}left( {\textbackslash}mathbb\{A\} {\textbackslash}right) {\textbackslash}right)\}\_\{{\textbackslash}left( M,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}pi  {\textbackslash}right)\}\},{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{where\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}left( M,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}pi  {\textbackslash}right) is a Levi subgroup with a cuspidal automorphic representation {$\pi\pi\backslash$}pi  taken modulo conjugacy.

P.T. Johnstone describes this point of view as ``the rejection of the idea that there is a fixed universe of `constant' sets within which mathematics can and should be developed, and the recognition that the notion of `variable structure' may be more conveniently handled within a universe of continuously variable sets.'' Time permitting, we'll sketch an application of the universal language of the topos of sheaves on the spectrum of a commutative ring that allows one to regard the ring as a local ring, at least locally.},

  abstract = {We provide a complete generators and relations presentation of the 2-dimensional extended unoriented and oriented bordism bicategories as symmetric monoidal bicategories. Thereby we classify these types of 2-dimensional extended topological field theories with arbitrary target bicategory. As an immediate corollary we obtain a concrete classification when the target is the symmetric monoidal bicategory of algebras, bimodules, and intertwiners over a fixed commutative ground ring. In the oriented case, such an extended topological field theory is equivalent to specifying a (non-commutative) separable symmetric Frobenius algebra. The text is divided into three chapters. The first develops a variant of higher Morse theory and uses it to obtain a combinatorial description of surfaces suitable for the higher categorical language used later. The second chapter is an extensive treatment of the theory of symmetric monoidal bicategories. We introduce several stricter variants on the notion of symmetric monoidal bicategory, and give a very general treatment of the notion of presentation by generators and relations. Finally we provide a host of strictification and cohernece results for symmetric monoidal bicategories. The final chapter focuses on extended tqfts. We give a precise treatment of the extended bordism bicategory equipped with additional structure (such as framings or orientations). We apply the results of the previous two chapters to obtain a simple presentation of both the oriented and unoriented bordism bicategories, and describe the general method to obtain such classifications for other choices of structure. We examine the consequences of our classification when the target is the bicategory of algebras, bimodules, and maps, over a fixed commutative ground ring.},

  abstract = {The cohomology H*⁢({$\Gamma$},E)\{H{\textasciicircum}\{*\}({\textbackslash}Gamma,E)\} of a torsion-free arithmetic subgroup {$\Gamma$} of the special linear {$\mathbb{Q}$}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\}-group {$\mathsf{G}$}=SLn\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{G\}=\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SL\}\}\_\{n\}\} may be interpreted in terms of the automorphic spectrum of {$\Gamma$}. Within this framework, there is a decomposition of the cohomology into the cuspidal cohomology and the Eisenstein cohomology. The latter space is decomposed according to the classes \{{$\mathsf{P}$}\}\{{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{P\}{\textbackslash}\}\} of associate proper parabolic {$\mathbb{Q}$}\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\}-subgroups of {$\mathsf{G}$}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{G\}\}. Each summand H\{P\}*⁢({$\Gamma$},E)\{H{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}\{P{\textbackslash}\}\}\}({\textbackslash}Gamma,E)\} is built up by Eisenstein series (or residues of such) attached to cuspidal automorphic forms on the Levi components of elements in \{{$\mathsf{P}$}\}\{{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{P\}{\textbackslash}\}\}. The cohomology H*⁢({$\Gamma$},E)\{H{\textasciicircum}\{*\}({\textbackslash}Gamma,E)\} vanishes above the degree given by the cohomological dimension cd⁢({$\Gamma$})=12⁢n⁢(n-1)\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cd\}({\textbackslash}Gamma)={\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}n(n-1)\}. We are concerned with the internal structure of the cohomology in this top degree. On the one hand, we explicitly describe the associate classes \{{$\mathsf{P}$}\}\{{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{P\}{\textbackslash}\}\} for which the corresponding summand H\{{$\mathsf{P}$}\}cd⁢({$\Gamma$})⁢({$\Gamma$},E)\{H{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cd\}({\textbackslash}Gamma)\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{P\}{\textbackslash}\}\}\}({\textbackslash}Gamma,E)\} vanishes. On the other hand, in the remaining cases of associate classes we construct various families of non-vanishing Eisenstein cohomology classes which span H\{{$\mathsf{Q}$}\}cd⁢({$\Gamma$})⁢({$\Gamma$},{$\mathbb{C}$})\{H{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cd\}({\textbackslash}Gamma)\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{Q\}{\textbackslash}\}\}\}({\textbackslash}Gamma,{\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\})\}. Finally, in the case of a principal congruence subgroup {$\Gamma$}⁢(q)\{{\textbackslash}Gamma(q)\}, q=p{$\nu\&$}gt;5\{q=p{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\&gt;5\}, p{$\geq$}3\{p{\textbackslash}geq 3\} a prime, we give lower bounds for the size of these spaces. In addition, for certain associate classes \{{$\mathsf{Q}$}\}\{{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{Q\}{\textbackslash}\}\}, there is a precise formula for their dimension.},

  author = {Seely, R. A. G.},
  abstract = {A brief outline of the categorical characterisation of Girard's linear logic is given, analagous to the relationship between cartesian closed categories and typed-calculus. The linear structure amounts to a-autonomous category: a closed symmetric monoidal category G with hnite products and a closed involution. Girard's exponential operator, ! , is a cotriple on G which carries the canonical comonoid structure on A with respect to cartesian product to a comonoid structure on !A with respect to tensor product. This makes the Kleisli category for ! cartesian closed. 0. INTRODUCTION. In {\textbackslash}Linear logic" "1987], Jean-Yves Girard introduced a logical system he described as {\textbackslash}a logic behind logic". Linear logic was a consequence of his analysis of the structure of qualitative domains (Girard 1986]): he noticed that the interpretation of the usual conditional {\textbackslash})" could be decomposed into two more primitive notions, a linear conditional {\textbackslash}" and a unary operator {\textbackslash}!" (called {\o}f course"), which is formally rather like an interior operator: (1) X) Y = !X Y The purpose of this note is to answer two questions (and perhaps pose some others.) First, if {\textbackslash}linear category" means the structure making valid the proportion linear logic : linear category = typed-calculus : cartesian closed category then what is a linear category? This question is quite easy, and in true categorical spirit, one ends that it was answered long before being put, namely by Barr 1979].},

  abstract = {Singular integrals are among the most interesting and important objects of study in analysis, one of the three main branches of mathematics. They deal with real and complex numbers and their functions. In this book, Princeton professor Elias Stein, a leading mathematical innovator as well as a gifted expositor, produced what has been called the most influential mathematics text in the last thirty-five years. One reason for its success as a text is its almost legendary presentation: Stein takes arcane material, previously understood only by specialists, and makes it accessible even to beginning graduate students. Readers have reflected that when you read this book, not only do you see that the greats of the past have done exciting work, but you also feel inspired that you can master the subject and contribute to it yourself.  Singular integrals were known to only a few specialists when Stein's book was first published. Over time, however, the book has inspired a whole generation of researchers to apply its methods to a broad range of problems in many disciplines, including engineering, biology, and finance.  Stein has received numerous awards for his research, including the Wolf Prize of Israel, the Steele Prize, and the National Medal of Science. He has published eight books with Princeton, including \emph{Real Analysis} in 2005.},

  abstract = {Since the 60s, semantics have proved most useful to introduce high-level languages allowing complex programs to be written and at an accurate mathematical level to be understood. In the 80s, linear logic was introduced by Girard following semantical properties reflecting resource usage in computation. This line of research was carried on by Ehrhard in the 2000s with the introduction of differential {$\lambda$}calculus. In its models, programs are approximated by polynomials whose monomials represent queries to inputs along computation. This analytic approach has been a key tool to study quantitative properties of programs such as probabilistic computation. In parallel, since the 90's, several geometric models was developed to give account to execution traces in distributed systems. In this habilitation thesis, we present models that we have studied in three distinct areas: distributed systems, differential lambda calculus, probabilistic programing, as well as general techniques to do so and the results they have allowed us to obtain. Those have required the use and the development of tools coming from combinatorics, directed topology, functional analysis, category theory and probability.},

We propose a new conjecture about the Harish-Chandra theory of such pairs, involving two integers e and m: namely, that the intersection of an {$\Phi$}e-Harish-Chandra series and a {$\Phi$}mHarish-Chandra series is parametrized by both a union of {$\Phi$}m-blocks of the {$\Phi$}e-Hecke algebra and a union of {$\Phi$}e-blocks of the {$\Phi$}m-Hecke algebra, in a way that matches blocks. We also conjecture that when blocks match, there is an equivalence of categories between their highest-weight covers. When e = 1, we provide evidence that our bijections are essentially realized by bimodules that Oblomkov--Yun construct from the cohomology of affine Springer fibers. This suggests a strange analogy: Roughly, homogeneous affine Springer fibers are to roots of unity as tensor products of Deligne--Lusztig representations are to prime powers.},

  abstract = {Several definitions have been given to express an exact meaning corresponding to the intuitive idea of `effective calculability' as applied for instance to functions of positive integers. The purpose of the present paper is to show that the computable functions introduced by the author are identical with the {$\lambda$}-definable functions of Church and the general recursive functions due to Herbrand and G{\"o}del and developed by Kleene. It is shown that every {$\lambda$}-definable function is computable and that every computable function is general recursive. There is a modified form of {$\lambda$}-definability, known as {$\lambda$}-               K               -definability, and it turns out to be natural to put the proof that every {$\lambda$}-definable function is computable in the form of a proof that every {$\lambda$}-               K               -definable function is computable; that every {$\lambda$}-definable function is {$\lambda$}-               K               -definable is trivial. If these results are taken in conjunction with an already available proof that every general recursive function is {$\lambda$}-definable we shall have the required equivalence of computability with {$\lambda$}-definability and incidentally a new proof of the equivalence of {$\lambda$}-definability and {$\lambda$}-               K               -definability.                                         A definition of what is meant by a computable function cannot be given satisfactorily in a short space. I therefore refer the reader to               Computable               pp. 230--235 and p. 254. The proof that computability implies recursiveness requires no more knowledge of computable functions than the ideas underlying the definition: the technical details are recalled in {\S}5.},

  abstract = {The geometric Langlands correspondence for complex algebraic curves differs from the original Langlands correspondence for number fields in that it is formulated in terms of sheaves rather than functions (in the intermediate case of curves over finite fields, both formulations are possible). In a recent preprint, Robert Langlands made a proposal for developing an analytic theory of automorphic forms on the moduli space of G-bundles on a complex algebraic curve. Langlands envisioned these forms as eigenfunctions of some analogues of Hecke operators. In these notes I show that if G is an abelian group then there are well-defined Hecke operators, and I give a complete description of their eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. For non-abelian G, Hecke operators involve integration, which presents some difficulties. However, there is an alternative approach to developing an analytic theory of automorphic forms, based on the existence of a large commutative algebra of global differential operators acting on half-densities on the moduli stack of G-bundles. This approach (which implements some ideas of Joerg Teschner) is outlined here, as a preview of a joint work with Pavel Etingof and David Kazhdan.},

The exponential modality is modelled by composing the jet comonad, whose Kleisli category has linear differential operators as morphisms, with the more familiar distributional comonad, whose Kleisli category has smooth maps as morphisms. Combining the two comonads gives a new interpretation of the semantics of differential linear logic where the Kleisli morphisms are smooth local functionals, or equivalently, smooth partial differential operators, and the codereliction map induces the functional derivative. This points towards a logic and hence computational theory of non-linear partial differential equations and their solutions based on variational calculus.},

This is the first book aimed at explaining forcing to general mathematicians.

This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras are also described. This book is suitable for second or third year graduate students. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics.  Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors. By making these tools more accessible, the book helps to break down the technological barrier between experts and casual users of homological algebra.},

Among the isogenous class of such an Abelian variety, we identify one whose Galois conjugates can be described in terms of actions of Atkin-Lehner operators and the class group of \$K\$. Thus we deduce that such Abelian varieties are parametrised by finite quotients of certain PEL Shimura varieties. These new families of moduli spaces are further analysed when they are of dimension \$2\$. We provide explicit numerical bounds for when they are surfaces of general type. In addition, for two particular examples, we show that they are both rational surfaces by computing the coordinates of inequivalent elliptic points and studying the intersections of Hirzebruch cycles with exceptional divisors.},

New functors from the representation category of a simple Lie algebra to that of another simple Lie algebra are given. Partial differential equations play key roles in solving certain representation problems. The weight matrices of the minimal and adjoint representations over the simple Lie algebras of types E and F are proved to generate ternary orthogonal linear codes with large minimal distances. New multi-variable hypergeometric functions related to the root systems of simple Lie algebras are introduced in connection with quantum many-body system in one-dimension. Certain equivalent combinatorial properties on representation formulas are found. Irreducibility of representations are proved directly related to algebraic varieties.},

  abstract = {SIMON CASTELLAN, Inria, Univ Rennes, IRISA, France L{\'E}O STEFANESCO, Coll{\`e}ge de France, France NOBUKO YOSHIDA, Imperial College London, United Kingdom Game semantics has proven to be a robust method to give compositional semantics for a variety of higherorder programming languages. However, due to the complexity of most game models, game semantics has remained unapproachable for non-experts. In this paper, we aim at making game semantics more accessible by viewing it as a syntactic translation into a session typed -calculus, referred to as metalanguage, followed by a semantics interpretation of the metalanguage into a particular game model. The syntactic translation can be defined for a wide range of programming languages without knowledge of the particular game model used. Simple reasoning on the model (soundness, and adequacy) can be done at the level of the metalanguage, escaping tedious technical proofs usually found in game semantics. We call this methodology programming game semantics. We design a metalanguage ( DiLL) inspired from Differential Linear Logic (DiLL), which is concise but expressive enough to support features required by concurrent game semantics. We then demonstrate our methodology by yielding the first causal, non-angelic and interactive game model of ML , a higher-order call-by-value language with shared memory concurrency. We translate ML into DiLL and show that the translation is adequate. We give a causal and non-angelic game semantics model using event structures, which supports a simple semantics interpretation of DiLL. Combining both of these results, we obtain the first interactive model of a concurrent language of this expressivity which is adequate with respect to the standard weak bisimulation, and fully abstract for the contextual equivalence on second-order terms. We have implemented a prototype which can explore the generated causal object from a subset of OCaml.},
