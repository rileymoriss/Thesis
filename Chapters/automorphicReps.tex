The references that will be most helpful are \cite[I.II]{borelAutomorphicFormsRepresentations1979}\cite{getzIntroductionAutomorphicRepresentations2024} for the general theory, we will follow the notation developed in \cite{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995} as it is somewhat standard. For the connection to classical modular forms there is \cite{emertonCLASSICALMODULARFORMS}\cite{bumpAutomorphicFormsRepresentations1997}\cite{booherVIEWINGMODULARFORMS}\cite{garrettTransitionEisensteinSeries2016}. We will discuss some of the details of their representation theory because it is both subtle and needed later. In particular we want to draw attention to what we think of as the "non-algebraic" nature of the representation theory.

\subsection{Definition and Role}
This is another one of the tools that can be used to compartmentalise problems in automorphic forms, by dealing with representations that appear in different parts of the spectrum.
