\section{Eisenstein Series}
As usual we fix a connected reductive group G defined over a number field F, with a Borel B, a standard parabolic with Levi decomposition \(P = MU\). 

Following the setup in \cite[I.1.4]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995} we consider a \(\chi\in \Hom_{\mathrm{LAG}}(M, \mathbb{G}_m)\), thinking of it below as a natural transformation, and then define 
\[|\chi|: M(\A)\to \C , \;\;\; (m_\nu)\mapsto \prod_\nu|\chi(F_\nu)(m_\nu)|_\nu.\]
The intersection of the kernels of these ``characters'' is 
\[M^1 \defeq \bigcap_{\chi\in \Hom_{\mathrm{LAG}}(M, \mathbb{G}_m)}\ker |\chi|.\]
Thus we can define
\[X_M \defeq \Hom_{\textrm{TopGroup}}(M(\A)/M^1, \C^*) .\]
i.e. characters of \(M(\A)\) that are trivial on \(M^1\).
\begin{remark}
    To make it seem less misterious this group has some importance in the more general theory, in particular it is one of the peices in the ``Langlands decomposition'' of the archimedean points of a parabolic and it has the property that \(M(\Q)\backslash M(\A)^1\) has finite measure.\cite[4.9]{getzIntroductionAutomorphicRepresentations2024} 
\end{remark}
If we have consider the set of complex characters of \(M\),
\[\mathfrak{a}_M^* \defeq \Hom_{\mathrm{LAG}}(M, \mathbb{G}_m )\tensor_\Z \C,\]
then this is isomorphic as \C vector spaces to \(X_M\). Finally if \(Z_G\) is the center of \(G\) then we also have the space 
\[X_M^G \defeq \Hom_{\textrm{TopGroup}}((M(\A)/M^1)/Z_G, \C^*)\]
which is characters of \(M(\A)/M^1\) which are also trivial on the center of \(G\).

\begin{example}
    For the maximal parabolic \(P_r\) with Levi \(M_r\) of \(\Sp_{2n}\) we have that \( X_{M_r}^{\Sp_{2n}}\) is at most a one dimensional \C vector space. 

    First of all we have that \cite[I.1.4]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}
         \[ X_{M_r}^{\Sp_{2n}} \subseteq X_{M_r} \cong \mathfrak{a}_{M_r}^*\defeq Rat(M_r) \tensor_\Z \C\]
        thus it is clearly sufficent to bound the dimension of \(\mathfrak{a}_{M_r}^*\) as a \C vector space, moreover this dimension agrees with the dimension of \(Rat(M_r)\) as a free \Z module. 

        Thus we compute \(\dim_\Z(Rat(M_r))\):
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                Rat(M_r) &= Rat(\GL_r \times \Sp_{2m}) \\
                         &= \Hom(\GL_r \times \Sp_{2m}, \mathbb{G}_m) \\
                         (2)&\cong \Hom(\mathrm{Ab}(\GL_r \times \Sp_{2m}), \mathbb{G}_m) \\
                         (1)&\cong \Hom(\mathrm{Ab}(\GL_r) \times \mathrm{Ab}(\Sp_{2m}), \mathbb{G}_m) \\
                         (3)&\cong \Hom(\mathbb{G}_m \times 1, \mathbb{G}_m) \\
                         &\cong \Z
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
        in (2) we have used the universal property of the abelianization \(\mathrm{Ab}(G) = \mathcal{D}(G) \setminus G = [G, G] \setminus G \) because \(\mathbb{G}_m\) is abelian. (1) is that the abelianization commutes with direct products (citation as comment in Tex). (3) is because \(\Sp\) is a perfect group.

\end{example}

\begin{remark}
    This generalises to the metaplectic covers immediately as \( X_{M_r}^{\Mp_{2n}(\A)} \subseteq X_{M_r}\).
\end{remark}
There is the natural map \(m_P: G(\A) \to M^1 \backslash M(\A)\) sending \(umk \mapsto M^1 m\), where \(g = umk\) using the Langlands-Iwasawa decomposition \ref{iwasawa_decomposition}.

Now if we take the collection of irreducible automorphic representatinos of \(M\), call it \(\hat{\mathcal{A}}\), then there is an action of \(X_M^G\) on \(\hat{\mathcal{A}}\) given by tensoring. Then \(\hat{\mathcal{A}}\) decomposes as a disjoint union of its orbits. Consider the orbit \(\mathfrak{P}\) of a cuspidal representation \(\pi_0\), then by definition \(X_M^G\) acts transitively but it also acts freely \cite[II.1]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}. Thus \(\mathfrak{P}\) is in bijection with \(X_M^G\). Through this bijection we transmit the comoplex structure on \(\mathfrak{a}_M^*\) to \(X_M\) then to the quotient \(X_M^G\) and finally to \(\mathfrak{P}\).

Now we will define an Eisenstein series: Let \(\mathfrak{P}\) be as above, let \(\pi\in \mathfrak{P}\) and \(\phi_\pi \in \mathcal{A}(U(\A)M(k)\backslash G(\A))_\pi\), then \(\lambda\in X_M^G\) acts on \(\phi_\pi\) by 
\[\lambda.\phi_\pi(g) = (\lambda \comp m_P)(g) \phi_\pi(g)\]
which is then an element of \(\mathcal{A}(U(\A)M(k)\backslash G(\A))_{\pi\tensor \lambda}\). Finally we have the \textbf{Eisenstein series} which is defined by the following sum
\[E(\phi_\pi, \lambda, g) = \sum_{\gamma \in P(k)\backslash G(k)} \lambda.\phi_\pi(\gamma g)\]
whenever it is convergent. The fisrt thing to note is that for a fixed \(\phi\) there is an open set in \(X_M^G\) and a compact subset of \(G(k)\backslash G(\A)\) such that the Eisenstein series converges (normally) \cite[II.1.5]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}.
\todo[inline]{They say its an automorphic form here but the compact set isnt all of G(\A) so i dont know how to interpret that...>}

If \(P = MU, P' = M'U'\) are two standard parabolics of \(G\) that are conjugate, i.e. such that for \(w\in G(k)\) we have \(wMw\inv = M'\)
Then \(w\) maps \(\mathfrak{P}\) to \(w\mathfrak{P}\), an orbit of an irreducible representations of \(M\) to an orbit of irreducible representaitons of \(M'\).

Then the Eisenstein series is closely related (through its constant terms \ref{constant_conjugate_levi}) to the operator
\[M(w, \pi)(\phi_\pi)(g) = \int_{(U'(k)\cap wU(k)w\inv )\backslash U'(\A)} \phi_\pi(w\inv ug) du\]
where \(\pi\in \mathfrak{P}\), \(g\in G(\A)\) and \(\phi_\pi \in \mathcal{A}(U(\A)M(k)\backslash G(\A))_\pi\).

The key properties of both the Eisenstien series and this operator can be found in \cite[IV.1.8, IV.1.9, IV.1.10, IV.1.11]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}. Most importantly as a function of \(\mathfrak{P}\) it can be shown that in the sense of Frechet spaces they both have a meromorphic continuation to all of \(\mathfrak{P}\). This was also given a second ``soft proof'' more recently in \cite{bernsteinMeromorphicContinuationEisenstein2022}, with the spectral decomposition that follows from it also being worked out in \cite{delormeSpectralTheoremLanglands2021}. Moreover for the Eisenstein series at a point in \(p\in \mathfrak{P}\) at which it is holomorphic then \(E(\phi,p, g)\) is an automorphic form. 

We are not really in a position to convey the true importance of these objects in the theory of automorphic forms, however we will make some comments. First some surveys are \cite{lapidPerspectivesEisensteinSeries2022}, \cite{arthurEisensteinSeriesTrace1979}, \cite{kimEISENSTEINSERIESTHEIR}, \cite{jiangResiduesEisensteinSeries2008a}. To see the relation to the classical Eisenstein series there is \cite{garrettTransitionEisensteinSeries2016}. One thing that Eisenstein series do, as in the theory of modular forms, is that they furnish us with quasi-concrete examples. If we have an automorphic form then the Eisenstein series is on occassion also an automorphic form and so we can multiply our examples. Another reason that these functions are important is through their normalisation and constant terms, in which products of L functions appear. This has been a fruitful method for proving theorems about L-functions as in \cite{shahidiEisensteinSeriesAutomorphic2010}\cite{pollackRANKINSELBERGMETHODUSER}\cite{arthurEisensteinSeriesTrace1979}.

\section{Spectral Decomposition}\label{spectral_decomposition}
This is a short explination of some terms that frequently appear as well as some motivation for the later results. The results contained here-in are proved using the Eisenstein series as an essential component. 

\subsection{The Decomposition of the Spectrum}
It is a classical theorem that for representations of finite groups over an algebraically closed field the regular representation decomposes into a direct sum, where ever irreducible representation appears. This still holds for compact groups \cite[5.1]{follandCourseAbstractHarmonic2016} and has a more general incarnation in the Plancherel theorem for type I, second countable and unimodular topological groups \cite[7.44]{follandCourseAbstractHarmonic2016}, which exibits the regular representation as a direct integral of the irreducible unitary representations. 

\todo[inline]{does this apply to \(G(\A)\)}
\todo[inline]{Example of direct integral}

Thus what one wants to do is find a decomposition of the regular representation \(G(\A) \curvearrowright \mathrm{L}^2(G(\A))\).
We call such decompositions ``spectral'', alluding to the spectral theorem which provides such a decomposition in terms of the eigenvector of certain operators. Moreover these decompositions are largely proved in terms of the more general spectral theorems. So once accomplished this is another one of the tools that can be used to compartmentalise problems in automorphic forms, by dealing with representations that appear in different parts of the spectrum. 

The key result in this theory is the following decomposition,
\begin{Theorem}[\cite{arthurEisensteinSeriesTrace1979}, MAIN THEOREM (b)]
    There is an orthogonal decomposition of the representation of \(G(\A)\) on \(L^2(G(\Q) \backslash G(\A))\) into 
    \[L^2(G(\Q) \backslash G(\A)) = \bigoplus_{\mathscr{P}}L^2_\mathscr{P}(G(\Q) \backslash G(\A)),\]
    where \(\mathscr{P}\) runs over certain ``associate classes'' of parabolics of \(G\) and the summands are the direct integrals of spaces of \(L^2\) automorphic forms.
\end{Theorem}
These direct integrals are in fact constructed out of subspaces generated by Eisenstein series. 

The spectrum of \(L^2(G(\A))\) refers to such a decomposition. In particular we have some important ``peices'' to such a decomposition. The piece that decomposes into a direct sum of irreducibles is called the \textbf{discrete spectrum}. The compliment of the discrete spectrum is called the \textbf{continuous spectrum}. One can define cuspidal \(L^2\) functions in the exact same way as cuspidal automorphic forms \ref{cuspidal_form_definition} and then it has been shown that the \textbf{cuspidal spectrum}, the subspace of \(L^2\) consisting of cusp forms, decomposes as a direct sum \cite[9]{getzIntroductionAutomorphicRepresentations2024}. Thus the cuspidal spectrum is contained in the discrete spectrum in this case. The \textbf{residual spectrum} is defined to be the compliment of the cuspidal spectrum in the discrete spectrum.

\subsection{Residual Spectrum}
Moeglin and Waldspurger also acheived a more fine analysis of the spectrum of \(\GL_n\) in terms of residues of Eisenstein series. 
First consider the group \(\GL_n\). We then let \(n = ab\) for positive integers \(a,b\). If \(\tau\) is an irreducible, cuspidal automorphic rep of \(\GL_a\) then Moeglin and Waldspurger construct a represntation of \(\GL_{ab} = \GL_n\) called the ``Speh representation'' and denote it 
\[\Delta(\tau, b).\]
They go on to prove that as \(\tau\) and \(b\) vary these representations span the residual spectrum of \(L^2(\GL_n(F) \backslash \GL_n(\A))\) \cite[Thm. 1.1]{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013}.

This represnentation is formed by taking iterated residues of Eisenstein series in the sense of \cite[V]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}. For a nice survey of problems in this area, of residues of Eisenstein series, there is \cite{jiangResiduesEisensteinSeries2008a}.



\section{Normalisation and Automorphic L-Functions}
\subsection{L-functions}
We dont intent to define in great detail automorphic L-functions, as there are many other better sources to learn from \cite[Part 2.III.2]{borelAutomorphicFormsRepresentations1979}\cite{shahidiEisensteinSeriesAutomorphic2010}\cite{cogdellLFUNCTIONSFUNCTORIALITY}\cite[9, 10, 11]{bumpIntroductionLanglandsProgram2004}\cite{arthurLfunctionsAutomorphicRepresenta}, we will recall the idea and then discuss some of the properties and relations with Eisenstein series and interwining operators that we will need later.

The first thing is to recall the classification of connected reductive groups defined over an algebraically closed field via root datum. A root datum is a tuple \((X, \Phi, \check{X} , \check{\Phi})\) where \(X\) and \(\check{X}\) are two free abelian groups of finite type, \(\Phi, \check{\Phi}\) are subgroups that are in duality via a perfect pairing on \(X, \check{X}\). Then each reductive group over a number field \(G\) has associated the root datum that is associated to its base change to \(\C\). Thus to a connected reductive group over a number field we associate a connected reductive group over \C, given by the dual root datum. We call this the dual group of \(G\) and denote it \(\hat{G}\). The Langlands dual group is then the dual group producted with the \(\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)\)
\[^L G \defeq \hat{G} \rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(\bar{k}/k).\]

\begin{example}[Classical Groups, \cite{bumpIntroductionLanglandsProgram2004}, 11.1]
    We have the following table
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \(G\)         & \(\hat{G}\)   \\ \hline
        \(\GL_n\)     & \(\GL_n\)     \\
        \(SO_{2n+1}\) & \(\Sp_{2n}\)  \\
        \(SO_{2n}\)   & \(SO_{2n}\)   \\
        \(\Sp_{2n}\)  & \(SO_{2n+1}\)
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
\end{example}

Then, using the Satake isomorphism \cite[2.2]{shahidiEisensteinSeriesAutomorphic2010}, to each unramified representation of \(G(F_\nu)\) we can associate a conjugacy class of \(^LG\), via some map call it \(c\), and hence there is a way to apply a complex representation \(r: ^LG \to \GL_n(\C)\) to representations of \(G(F_\nu)\). Thus the automorphic L-functions are defined as follows: Let \(\rho\) be a representaion of \(G(\A)\), let \(r\) be a complex representation of \(^LG\) and \(s\in \C\) then 
\[L(s, \rho, r) \defeq \prod_\nu L_\nu(s, \rho_\nu, r ) = \prod_\nu \frac{1}{\det\bigl( I - r(c(\rho_\nu))q^{-s} \bigr)}  ,\]
where \(\nu\) runs over the unramified places. It is a part of the grand Langlands philosophy that there should be suitable L-functions for the ramified places satisfying very nice properties.

\begin{remark}
    The global L-functions have been defined for many groups at this point and indeed \cite{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013} uses known properties to prove their results. One should not that the questions that we are interested in are still tractable even though the L-functions might not be defined (for instance for the metaplectic group). This is because only finitely many places will ramify, and so as long as those places are neither zero or poles we can transfer questions about zeros and poles from the full global L-functions to L-functions at almost all places. 
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[Standard Representations / Classical Groups]
    In the case of classical groups it is common to see L-functions with only two entries e.g. if \(\rho\) is a representation of \(G = \Sp{2n}\) then you may see 
    \(L(s, \rho).\)
    The reason is that there is a standard representation of the dual groups of classical groups. Namely the standard representation of a matrix group inside \(\GL_n\) is the one that sends \(g\mapsto g\). It is this representation that is to be taken for the dual group in this setting.
\end{example}


\begin{example}[Dirichlet L-functions]
    Recall that a Dirichlet character \(\chi\) is a character of the group \((\Z/N\Z)^*\). Through the series of maps 
    \[A^\times \cong \Q^\times \times \R_{>0}^\times \times \hat{\Z}^\times \to (\lim \Z/N\Z)^\times \to (\Z/N\Z)^\times \to \C,\]
    one get a bijection between Dirichlet characters and finite-order Grossencharacters, i.e. characters of \(\A_F^\times/F^\times\).
    Grossencharacters have the associated L-function as they are just automorphic forms of \(\GL_1\), which generate automorphic representations. These give us the classical Dirichlet L-functions.\todo{reference? More details?}
\end{example}
