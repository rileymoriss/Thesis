The Eisenstein series is from our perspective the most important tool in the theory of automorphic forms. Some surveys on its role, properties and open problems are \cite{lapidPerspectivesEisensteinSeries2022}, \cite{arthurEisensteinSeriesTrace1979}, \cite{kimEISENSTEINSERIESTHEIR} and \cite{jiangResiduesEisensteinSeries2008a}. To see the relation to the classical Eisenstein series there is \cite{garrettTransitionEisensteinSeries2016} which we will also go through in section \ref{sec:classic-eisenstein}. One thing that Eisenstein series do, as in the theory of modular forms, is that they furnish us with quasi-concrete examples of automorphic forms. Another reason that these functions are important is through their normalisation and constant terms, in which products of L functions appear, we discuss this more in section \ref{sec:L-functions}. This has been a fruitful method for proving theorems about L-functions as in \cite{shahidiEisensteinSeriesAutomorphic2010}\cite{pollackRANKINSELBERGMETHODUSERS}\cite{arthurEisensteinSeriesTrace1979}, or conversely proving theorems about Eisenstein series \cite{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013}.

\section{Eisenstein Series}\label{sec:eisenstein-series}
As usual we fix a classical group G defined over a number field F, with a Borel B and a standard parabolic with Levi decomposition \(P = MU\). 

Following the setup in \cite[I.1.4]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995} we consider a \textbf{character} \(\chi\in \mathrm{Rat}(M) \defeq \Hom_{\mathrm{LAG}}(M, \mathbb{G}_m)\), thinking of it below as a natural transformation, and then define 
\[|\chi|: M(\A)\to \C , \;\;\; (m_\nu)\mapsto \prod_\nu|\chi(F_\nu)(m_\nu)|_\nu.\]
The intersection of the kernels of these characters is 
\[M^1 \defeq \bigcap_{\chi\in \mathrm{Rat}(M)}\ker |\chi|.\]
The collection of characters of \(M(\A)\) that are trivial on \(M^1\) is denoted
\[X_M \defeq \Hom_{\textrm{TopGroup}}(M(\A)/M^1, \C^*) .\]

\begin{remark}
    To make it seem less mysterious we comment that this group has some importance in the more general theory. It is one of the pieces in the ``Langlands decomposition'' of the Archimedean points of a parabolic \(P = MU\), if \(\nu\) is an archimedean place then,
    \[P(F_\nu) = A_M M(F_\nu)U(F_\nu).\]
    We will not define \(A_M\).
    It also has the property that \(M(\Q)\backslash M(\A)^1\) has finite measure \cite[4.9]{getzIntroductionAutomorphicRepresentations2024}.
\end{remark}
The set of \textbf{complex characters} of \(M\),
\[\mathfrak{a}_M^* \defeq \mathrm{Rat}(M)\tensor_\Z \C,\]
is isomorphic as \C vector spaces to \(X_M\). If \(Z_{G(\A)}\) is the center of \(G(\A)\) then we also have the space 
\[X_M^G \defeq \Hom_{\textrm{TopGroup}}((M(\A)/M^1)/Z_G, \C^*),\]
which is characters of \(M(\A)/M^1\) which are also trivial on the center of \(G\).

\begin{example}\label{ex:characters}
    For the maximal parabolic \(P_r\) with Levi \(M_r\) of \(\Sp_{2n}\) we have that \( X_{M_r}^{\Sp_{2n}}\) is at most a one dimensional \C vector space. 

    First of all we have that \cite[I.1.4]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}
         \[ X_{M_r}^{\Sp_{2n}} \subseteq X_{M_r} \cong \mathfrak{a}_{M_r}^*\defeq Rat(M_r) \tensor_\Z \C.\]
        Thus it is clearly sufficient to bound the dimension of \(\mathfrak{a}_{M_r}^*\) as a \C vector space, moreover this dimension agrees with the dimension of \(Rat(M_r)\) as a free \Z module. 

        Thus we compute \(\dim_\Z(Rat(M_r))\):
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                Rat(M_r) &= Rat(\GL_r \times \Sp_{2m}) \\
                         &= \Hom(\GL_r \times \Sp_{2m}, \mathbb{G}_m) \\
                         (1)&\cong \Hom(\mathrm{Ab}(\GL_r \times \Sp_{2m}), \mathbb{G}_m) \\
                         (2)&\cong \Hom(\mathrm{Ab}(\GL_r) \times \mathrm{Ab}(\Sp_{2m}), \mathbb{G}_m) \\
                         (3)&\cong \Hom(\mathbb{G}_m \times 1, \mathbb{G}_m) \\
                         &\cong \Z.
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}
        In (1) we have used the universal property of the abelianization \(\mathrm{Ab}(G) = \mathcal{D}(G) \setminus G = [G, G] \setminus G \) because \(\mathbb{G}_m\) is abelian. (2) is that the abelianization commutes with direct products. (3) is because \(\Sp\) is a perfect group.

There is the natural map \(m_P: G(\A) \to M^1 \backslash M(\A)\) sending \(umk \mapsto M^1 m\), where \(g = umk\) using the Langlands-Iwasawa decomposition of equation \ref{eq:iwasawa_decomposition}.

Now if we take the collection of irreducible automorphic representations of \(M\),
 \[\hat{\mathcal{M}} \defeq \{(\pi, V) : \pi \text{ is an irreducible automorphic representation of }M\},\]
then we can think of \(X_M^G\) as being one dimensional automorphic representations (with some extra invariance) and so there is a natural action on \(\hat{\mathcal{M}}\) given by tensoring, i.e. if \(\lambda\in X_M^G\) and \((\pi, V)\in \hat{\mathcal{M}}\) then 
\[\lambda.\pi \defeq \lambda\tensor \pi.\]
Then \(\hat{\mathcal{M}}\) decomposes as a disjoint union of its orbits. The orbit \(\mathfrak{P}\) of a cuspidal representation \(\pi_0\) is called a \textbf{cuspidal datum}. By definition \(X_M^G\) acts transitively on any cuspidal datum \(\mathfrak{P}\) but by \cite[II.1]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995} it also acts freely. Thus \(\mathfrak{P}\) is in bijection with \(X_M^G\). Through this bijection we transmit the complex structure on \(\mathfrak{a}_M^*\) to \(X_M\) then to the quotient \(X_M^G\) and finally to \(\mathfrak{P}\).

Let \(\mathfrak{P}\) be a cuspidal datum with a complex structure as above. Let \(\pi\in \mathfrak{P}\) and \(\phi_\pi \in \mathcal{A}(U(\A)M(k)\backslash G(\A))_\pi\), then \(\lambda\in X_M^G\) acts on \(\phi_\pi\) by 
\[\lambda.\phi_\pi(g) = (\lambda \comp m_P)(g) \phi_\pi(g).\]
which is then an element of \(\mathcal{A}(U(\A)M(k)\backslash G(\A))_{\pi\tensor \lambda}\). Finally we have the \textbf{Eisenstein series} which is defined by the following sum
\[E(\phi_\pi, \lambda, g) = \sum_{\gamma \in P(k)\backslash G(k)} \lambda.\phi_\pi(\gamma g),\]
whenever it is convergent. The first thing to note is that for a fixed \(\phi\) there is an open set in \(X_M^G\) and a compact subset of \(G(k)\backslash G(\A)\) such that the Eisenstein series converges (normally) \cite[II.1.5]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}.

If \(P = MU, P' = M'U'\) are two standard parabolics of \(G\) that are conjugate, i.e. such that for \(w\in G(k)\) we have \(wMw\inv = M'\).
Then \(w\) maps \(\mathfrak{P}\) to \(w\mathfrak{P}\), an orbit of an irreducible representations of \(M\) to an orbit of irreducible representations of \(M'\).
The Eisenstein series is closely related through its constant terms (as discussed in section \ref{constant_conjugate_levi}) to the operator
\[M(w, \pi)(\phi_\pi)(g) = \int_{(U'(k)\cap wU(k)w\inv )\backslash U'(\A)} \phi_\pi(w\inv ug) du,\]
where \(\pi\in \mathfrak{P}\), \(g\in G(\A)\) and \(\phi_\pi \in \mathcal{A}(U(\A)M(k)\backslash G(\A))_\pi\).

The Eisenstein series has three inputs and can be considered as a function in different variables, it can be a tedious task to specify the correct domain and codomains for these maps however. If \(\pi\) is a cuspidal automorphic representation induced from \(P\), then for a fixed \(\phi \in\mathcal{A}_0(U(\A)M(k)\setminus G(\A))_\pi \) the Eisenstein series \(E(\phi)\) can be thought of as a function from some open subset of the cuspidal datum \(\mathfrak{P}\) into \(L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}(G)\), the set of locally square integrable complex valued functions on \(G(\A)\), given by 
\[E(\phi)(\lambda)(g) = \sum_{\gamma \in P(k)\backslash G(k)} \lambda.\phi(\gamma g), \;\;\; \lambda\in \mathfrak{P},\; g\in G(\A),\]
where it converges. The space \(L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}(G(\A))\) can be endowed with a Frechet space structure coming from the semi-norms associated to compact sets \(C\subseteq G(\A)\) given by 
\[\phi \mapsto \norm{\phi|_C}_{L^2} = \int_C |\phi(x)|^2 \mathrm{d}x.\] 
Then it makes sense to talk about the holomorphicity of \(E(\phi)\) in this sense \cite[I.4.9]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}. The key properties of both the Eisenstein series and this operator can be found in \cite[IV.1.8, IV.1.9, IV.1.10, IV.1.11]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995}. Most importantly as a function of \(\mathfrak{P}\) it can be shown that they both have a meromorphic continuation to all of \(\mathfrak{P}\). This was also given a second ``soft proof'' more recently in \cite{bernsteinMeromorphicContinuationEisenstein2023}, with the spectral decomposition that follows from it also being worked out in \cite{delormeSpectralTheoremLanglands2021}. Moreover an Eisenstein series attached to an automorphic form, at a point \(p\in \mathfrak{P}\) at which it is holomorphic, is also an automorphic form. 

\section{Classical Eisenstein Series}\label{sec:classic-eisenstein}

We will follow the excellent exposition in \cite{garrettTransitionEisensteinSeries2016}, the section \cite[1.2]{bruinier123ModularForms2008} on classical Eisenstein series. The typical example of a classical Eisenstein series is that defined on \(s\in \C\) by the meromorphic continuation of the sum
\[\mathbf{E}(z, s) \defeq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(m,n)\in \Z^2\setminus \{(0,0)\}, \text{ coprime }} \frac{\mathrm{Im}(z)^{s}}{|mz+n|^{2s}}, \quad z\in \mathcal{H},\]
which converges absolutely for \(\mathrm{Re}(s)>\frac{1}{2}\). Consider the algebraic group \(\SL_2\) with the parabolic of upper triangular matrices \(P\).

First we want to look at the index of the sum, we aim to define a map
	\[\omega: P(\Z) \backslash \SL_2(\Z) \to  \{(m,n)\in \Z^2\backslash\{(0,0)\} : m,n \text{ are co-prime}\}.\]

	The cosets of \(P(\Z) \backslash \SL_2(\Z)\) look like
	\[P(\Z)\begin{pmatrix}
		a & b \\ c& d
	\end{pmatrix} = \left\{\pm\begin{pmatrix}
		1 & n \\&1
	\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
	a & b \\ c& d
	\end{pmatrix} : n\in \Z\right\} = \left\{\pm\begin{pmatrix}
	a+nc & b+nd \\ c & d
	\end{pmatrix} : n\in \Z\right\}.\]
	Moreover because \(\begin{pmatrix}
		a & b \\ c& d
	\end{pmatrix}\in \SL_2(\Z)\) we have by Bezout's lemma (applied to the determinant expression) that \(c\) and \(d\) are co-prime. Therefore there is a well defined map 
	\[P(\Z) \backslash \SL_2(\Z) \to  \{(m,n)\in \Z^2\backslash\{(0,0)\} : m,n \text{ are co-prime}\},\]
	if we denote \(\mathrm{ind}\{c<0\} = \begin{cases}
		0, & c\geq 0\\
		1, & c<0
	\end{cases}\) then it is given by 
	\[\left\{\pm\begin{pmatrix}
		a+nc & b+nd \\ c & d
	\end{pmatrix} : n\in \Z\right\}\mapsto (|c|,(-1)^{\mathrm{ind}\{c<0\}}d).\]
	The point is that \(|mz + n| = |(-m)z + (-n)|\) and so the sum in the Eisenstein series, having a prefactor of a half is really just the sum over \( \{(m,n)\in \Z^2\backslash\{(0,0)\} : m,n \text{ are co-prime \textbf{and} }m\geq 0\}\), which by our argument is in bijection with \(P(\Z) \backslash \SL_2(\Z)\) via \(\omega\).
	

	

\begin{Lemma}[\cite{garrettTransitionEisensteinSeries2016}, 3.5]
	\[P(\Z) \backslash \SL_2(\Z) \cong P(\Q) \backslash \SL_2(\Q). \]
\end{Lemma}
\proofbar{
	The bijection is explicitly
	\[P(\Z)g\mapsto P(\Q)g.\]

	
	Injectivity is clear because if \(g, g'\in \SL_2(\Z)\) are in the same \(P(\Q)\) orbit then we can cancel the denominators of the \(P(\Q)\) matrix and hence \(g,g'\) are in the same \(P(\Z)\) orbit.
	
	Surjectivity follows from a repeated application of the orbit stabilizer theorem, as in \cite[3.5]{garrettTransitionEisensteinSeries2016}.
}
Recall that \(\SL_2(\Z)\) acts via Mobius transformations on the upper half plane. If \(z= x+ iy \in \mathcal{H}\), \(s\in \C\) and \(\gamma = \begin{pmatrix}
	a & b\\ c& d \end{pmatrix}\in \SL_2(\Z)\) then an elementary computation shows that,
\[\mathrm{Im}(\gamma.z) = \frac{\mathrm{Im}(z)}{|cz + d|^{2}}.\]
Hence the classical Eisenstein series is
\[\mathbf{E}(z, s) \defeq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{m,n\in \Z, \text{ coprime }} \frac{\mathrm{Im}(z)^{s}}{|mz+n|^{2s}} = \sum_{\gamma\in P(\Q)\backslash \SL_2(\Q)} \mathrm{Im}(\gamma.z)^{s},\]
Where these sum are notation for their meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. 

We want to realize this as the Eisenstein series associated to an automorphic form so first we must design a function on \(\SL_2(\A)\). For any place \(\nu\) of \Q we have the local Iwasawa decomposition \(\SL_2(\Q_\nu) = P(\Q_\nu) K_\nu\) where 
\[K_\nu \defeq \begin{cases}
	\SL_2(\Z_\nu), & \nu \text{ non-Archimedean}\\
	\SO_2(\R), & \nu \text{ Archimedean}
\end{cases}.\]
 are the local maximal compact subgroups. We define a function on the adeles by defining it on the local pieces,
 \[\phi_{\nu, s}\left(\begin{pmatrix}
 	a & b\\ & d
 \end{pmatrix}k\right) \defeq \left| \frac{a}{d} \right|_\nu^s .\]
 Finally we define \(\phi_s\) as the map 
 \[(g_\nu)_{\nu} \mapsto \prod_\nu \phi_{\nu,s}(g_\nu).\]
 
 \begin{Lemma}
 	\(\phi_s\) is an automorphic form on \(\SL_2(\A)\).
 \end{Lemma}
 \proofbar{
 	Smooth, moderate growth and \(K\)-finiteness are obvious from the definition.	
 	Using the product formula, i.e. for all \(x\in \Q^\times\) we have that \(\prod_\nu |x|_\nu = 1\), we get that \(\phi_s\) is left \(\SL_2(\Q)\) invariant. \(Z(\mathfrak{g})\) finiteness can be checked using the known Casimir of the Lie algebra of \(\SL_2(\R)\), which we again omit.
 }
 
 To this we have an Eisenstein series associate as in the adelic setting by 
 \[E(\phi, g) \defeq \sum_{\gamma\in P(\Q)\backslash \SL_2(\Q)} \phi_s(\gamma g) .\]

\begin{Lemma}
	Let \(g\in \SL_2(\R)\) then we consider it as an element of \(\SL_2(\A)\), denoted by \(\iota(g)\), by setting all other entries to 1. Then 
	\[E(\phi_s, \iota(g)) = \mathbf{E}(g.i,s)\]
\end{Lemma}
\proofbar{
	First the left hand side,
	\begin{align*}
		E(\phi_s, \iota(g)) &= \sum_{\gamma\in P(\Q)\backslash \SL_2(\Q)} \phi_s(\gamma \iota(g)) \\
		&= \sum_{\gamma\in P(\Z)\backslash \SL_2(\Z)} \prod_\nu\phi_{\nu,s}(\gamma g_\nu) \\
		&= \sum_{\gamma\in P(\Z)\backslash \SL_2(\Z)} \phi_{\infty,s}(\gamma g) \prod_{\nu<\infty} \phi_{s, \nu}(\gamma)\\
		&= \sum_{\gamma\in P(\Z)\backslash \SL_2(\Z)} \phi_{\infty,s}(\gamma g).\\
	\end{align*}
	Because \(\gamma\in \SL_2(\Z)\subseteq \SL_2(\Z_\nu)\) for each place \(\nu\) and so \(\phi_{s, \nu}\) is by definition trivial on these.  The final step is then to show that 
	\[\phi_{\infty, s} (g) = |\mathrm{Im}(g.i)|^s.\]
	
	If \(\begin{pmatrix}
		a& b\\ c&d
	\end{pmatrix}\in \SL_2(\R)\) then for some \(k\in \SO_2(\R)\) we have that  \cite{conradDecomposingSL2R},
	\[\begin{pmatrix}
		a& b\\ c&d
	\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
		(a^2 + c^2)^{\frac{1}{2}} & \ast \\ & (a^2 + c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
	\end{pmatrix} .\]
	With this explicit Iwasawa decomposition the proof is finished with some elementary matrix manipulation, this is done very explicitly in \cite[3.3]{garrettTransitionEisensteinSeries2016}.
