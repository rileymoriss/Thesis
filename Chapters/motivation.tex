We have tried to motivate the individual objects as we went, how they would help get us to the result that we were looking for. Here we try to provide a birds eye veiw of whats going on.

We do have to preface that much like the motivation throughout we have only understood a small piece of the story here, however we still feel obligated to communicate what we can.

Paul Garrett said to me something along the lines of it being arguably more important to understand the \textit{role} of the Eisenstein series in the theory of automorphic forms rather than the technical details of its proof of meromorphicity. I think to some extent he is correct, not to say that the proof isnt important, only that its importance is given to it by its role and is hence subservient to it. 

Try to elaborate the role of each introduced item in the theory, not just its technical properties.
