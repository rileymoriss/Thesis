\label{ch:jiang}
Our goal here is to exposit and survey the work in papers such as \cite{brennerNotesAnalyticProperties2009}\cite{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013}\cite{ginzburgTopFourierCoefficients2021} and perhaps give a trivial extension of them. The idea is to locate the poles and zeroes of certain Eisenstein series. 

\cite{brennerNotesAnalyticProperties2009} gave an analysis of the residual poles of Eisenstein series attached to \(\Sp_{2n}\), there were some minor errors that were corrected in \cite{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013} where they give esssentially the same proof; theirs however works for the other classical groups. For our purposes, the case of \(\Sp_{2n}\), as a group defined over \(F\) a number field, is most relevant, and we shall therefore focus exclusively on this case, however it should be noted that this limitation in the non-covering case is artificial, although it does simplify things a little by removing some casework, and we hope also in the covering case to be able to remove it in future work. 

\section{Residual Eisenstein Series}
So for the rest of the chapter we will fix an \(n\in \N\), \(G_n = \Sp_{2n}\) and the Borel of upper triangular matrices in \(\Sp_{2n} \), then we look at partitions of \(n = r + m\), where \(1\leq r,m \leq n\) and \(r,m\in \Z\). Then as we saw in \ref{maximal_parabolic} there corresponds a maximal standard (proper) parabolic of \(\Sp_{2n}\), which we denote \(P_r = M_rN_r\), such that the Levi component is 
\[\GL_r\times \Sp_{2m} \]
As we saw in \ref{ex:characters} the space of characters \(X^{\Sp_{2n}}_{M_r}\) is one dimensional by the maximality of \(P_r\). If we look at the divisors of \(r = ab\)
 and fix a \(\tau\), an irreducible unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of \(\GL_a\), then from \ref{residual_spec} we know that \(\Delta(\tau, b)\) is a residual representation of \(\GL_{ab} = \GL_r\). Now we take an irreducible generic cuspidal automorphic representation \(\sigma\) of \(\Sp_{2m}\), and so their tensor product \(\Delta(\tau, b) \tensor \sigma\) gives a representation of \(\GL_{r}\times \Sp_{2m}\) and hence of the Levi \(M_r\). We now consider the Eisenstein series attached to this representation, namely if 
\[\phi\in \mathcal{A}(N_r(\A)M_r(F)\setminus \Sp_{2n}(\A) )_{\Delta(\tau, b)\tensor \sigma}\] 
then we have the Eisenstein series
\[E(\phi, s)(g) = \sum_{\gamma\in P_r(F) \setminus \Sp_{2n}(F)} s.\phi(\gamma g)\]
for \(g\in \Sp_{2n}(F) \setminus \Sp_{2n}(\A)\). Becuase it is induced from the residual representation \(\Delta(\tau, b)\) we call these residual Eisenstein series.

This is the setup in \cite{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013}, where they prove their results by a sort of induction on \(b\). Here we will focus exclusively on the base case of this induction, leaving the inductive step for future work. So from now on we will fix \(b = 1\). Hence \(n = a + m\). Then fixing a standard parabolic of \(\Sp_{2n}\) we have the maximal standard parabolic \(P_a = M_aN_a\) where \(M_a = \GL_a \times \Sp_{2m}\).  Now if \(\tau\) is irreducible unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of \(\GL_a\) then by definition \ref{residual_spec}
\[\Delta(\tau, 1)(\phi)(g) = E(\phi,s)(g) = s.\phi(g)\]
where the Eisenstein series is defined via the parabolic induction from the Levi \((\GL_a)^{\times b} \) to \(\GL_{ab}\). Thus we have \(\Delta(\tau, 1) = \tau\).

    \section{Our Results}
We consider an almost identical setup but we deal with the metaplectic cover of \(\Sp_{2n}\), again over a number field \(F\), \(\Mp_{2n}\)\todo[inline]{reference the section I discuss this in.}. We again fix the Borel of upper triangular matricies, consider partitions of \(n = r+m\) and look at maximal standard parabolics of \(\Sp_{2n}\), \(P_r = M_rN_r\) such that 
\[M_r = \GL_r \times \Sp_{2m}\]
then if \(r = ab\) we still have that \(\Delta(\tau, b)\tensor \sigma\), for \(\tau\) irreducible unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of \(\GL_a\) and \(\sigma\) irreducible generic cuspidal automorphic representation of \(\Sp_{2m}\), is a representation of \(M_r\). The difference is in the parabolic induction as we now consider 
\[\phi\in \mathcal{A}(N_r(\A)M_r(F)\setminus \Mp_{2n}(\A) )_{\Delta(\tau, b)\tensor \sigma}\] 
and then the Eisenstein series is defined in the same way
\[E(\phi, s)(g) = \sum_{\gamma\in P_r(F) \setminus \Sp_{2n}(F)} s.\phi(\gamma g)\]
for \(g\in \Sp_{2n}(F) \setminus \Mp_{2n}(\A)\) and \(s\in \C \cong X^{\Mp_{2n}}_{M_r}\).

\begin{Lemma}
When \(b = 1\) we have the constant term
    \[E(\phi,s)(g)_{P_a} = \phi(g)_{P_a} + M(\omega, \tau\tensor\sigma)(\phi)(g)\]
\end{Lemma}

\section{The Constant Term}
So far we only know how to do one thing with such Eisenstein series and that is compute their constant term. We will compute the constant term along the maximal parabolic \(P_a = MN\) becuase by \cite[II.1.7 (ii)]{moeglinSpectralDecompositionEisenstein1995} the others are zero.

By our earlier calculations \ref{const_eisenstein}, the fact that the tensor of cuspidal representations is cuspidal and \cite{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013} we know that 
     \[E(\phi, s)_{P} = \sum_{ w} \sum_{m'} \int_{(w\inv N(\A)w \cap M(\A)) \setminus A} \int_{w\inv N(F) w \cap M(F) \setminus w\inv N(\A)w \cap M(\A)} s.\phi( n_1 n_2 w\inv m' x)  dn_1 dn_2,\] 
     and the inner integral vanishes for all \(w\neq id, \omega\) (\(\omega\) as in \cite{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013})\todo[color=orange]{I would like to expand on this if there is time}. Hence the first sum becomes over two elements and we have 

     \[E(\phi, s)_{P} = E(\phi, s)_{P, id} + E(\phi, s)_{P, \omega}.\]
     where 
     \[E(\phi, s)_{P, w}(x) =  \sum_{m'\in M(F)\cap wP(F)w\inv\setminus M(F)} \int_{N(F)\cap wP(F)w\inv \setminus N(\A)} s.\phi( w\inv nm' x)  dn.\]

First the identity term simplifies

     \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            E(\phi, s)_{P', id} (x)&=  \sum_{m'\in M(F)\cap P(F)\setminus M(F)} \int_{N(F)\cap P(F) \setminus N(\A)} s.\phi( nm' x)  dn\\
            &= \sum_{m'\in M(F)\setminus M(F)} \int_{N(F)\setminus N(\A)} s.\phi( nm' x)  dn \\
            &=\int_{N(F)\setminus N(\A)} s.\phi( n x)  dn \\
            &= s.\phi(x)_P.
        \end{aligned}
     \end{equation*}

     Considering now the \(\omega\) term 
     \[E(\phi, s)_{P, \omega}(x) =  \sum_{m'\in M(F)\cap \omega P(F)\omega\inv\setminus M(F)} \int_{N(F)\cap \omega P(F)\omega\inv \setminus N(\A)} s.\phi( \omega\inv nm' x)  dn.\]

     By \cite[2C]{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013} \(M(F)\cap \omega P(F)\omega\inv \setminus M(F)\) is isomorphic to \(P_0 \setminus \Sp_{2(n-a)}\), but \(P_0\) has Levi \(M_0 = \Sp_{2(n-a)}\) by definition and hence is itself \(\Sp_{2(n-a)}\). Thus the sum is over \(\Sp_{2(n-a)}(F) \setminus \Sp_{2(n-a)}(F)\) and hence is over a point. Therefore we get by definition of the intertwining operator
     \[E(\phi, s)_{P, \omega}(x) = \int_{N(F)\cap \omega P(F)\omega\inv \setminus N(\A)} \phi( \omega\inv n x)  dn = M(\omega, s)(\phi)(x)\]
     because we took the constant term along the same parabolic as the definition of the Eisenstein series we know that the Levis are (the same) conjugate.
    Thus we have shown that 
    \[E(\phi, s)_P = s.\phi_P + M(\omega, s )(\phi)\]
    \begin{remark}
        This work was entirely at the level of the terminals and hence generalises verbatim to covering groups.
    \end{remark}
    
    Because \(\phi\) is an automorphic form it has no poles and so we have shown the following:
    \begin{Lemma}[Base case of \cite{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013}, 2.1]
        The poles of \(E(\phi, s)\) are exactly the poles of \(E(\phi,s)_{P_a}\) which are exactly the poles of \(M(\omega, s)\).
    \end{Lemma}
    

    \section{Analysing the Intertwining Operator}
    Recall from \ref{L_inter} that we know in this case that there is some ratio of \(L\)-functions \(r(s, \omega)\) such that \(M(s,\omega) = r(s, \omega)N(s, \omega)\) where \(N(s, \omega)\) is both holomorphic and non-zero. 
     In the case we are considering the normalising factor \(r\) is given by the equation \cite[4A]{jiangPolesCertainResidual2013}
     \[r(w, s) = \frac{L(s, \tau\times \sigma)L(2s, \tau,\wedge^2)}{L(s+1, \tau\times \sigma)L(2s+1, \tau, \wedge^2)},\]
    where \(\wedge^2\) denotes the exterior second power of the standard representation of \(\GL_a(\C)\). Thus

     \begin{Lemma}
        The Eisenstein series above has pole at \(s\) if and only if \(r(w,s)\) has a pole.
     \end{Lemma}
     The final step is then to use the known properties of \(L\)-functions to conclude when our \(r\)-factor will have poles and of what order those poles will be.
